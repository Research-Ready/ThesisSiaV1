\chapter{Executive Summary}\label{executive-summary}

VIRIDIS is a European company active in the green technology sector. To
survive and grow, the company must attract significantly more investment
in sustainable projects. The current governance model is hierarchical
and centralised, which creates barriers in transparency, inclusivity,
and stakeholder engagement. These barriers limit trust from investors,
restrict employee and partner participation, and weaken VIRIDIS's
ability to capture opportunities in the fast-growing sustainable finance
market
(\citeproc{ref-european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth}{Commission,
2019}).

This thesis investigates whether a decentralised governance system can
provide a better alternative to the traditional model. It is guided by
three central research questions. First, is a decentralised governance
system more effective than a traditional one in increasing investment
and participation rates. Second, does inclusion in decision-making
stimulate active stakeholder engagement in other VIRIDIS projects,
thereby strengthening the network effect. Third, does a decentralised
governance model specifically direct more capital into green technology
rather than general technology.

The research is conducted as a single-case study of VIRIDIS, with its
governance transition as the primary unit of analysis. Sector-wide
transformations and macroeconomic frameworks including the European
Green Deal, the EU Taxonomy, and global sustainable finance initiatives
are addressed only as contextual background to situate VIRIDIS's
challenges and opportunities. This ensures the study remains focused on
VIRIDIS while acknowledging the broader policy and market landscape in
which the company operates.

The study draws on theory from blockchain governance, decentralised
finance, and sustainable finance, combined with practical research
methods such as stakeholder analysis, ideation sessions, iteration
rounds, and prototype testing. Findings suggest that a tailored DAO
model can address the key governance gaps of VIRIDIS. Decentralised
decision-making improves transparency, builds trust, and creates
incentives for wider participation, while aligning the company with
European frameworks such as the Green Deal, EU Taxonomy, and ESG
disclosure rules (\citeproc{ref-tkachuk2023-efficient-design}{Tkachuk,
2023}; \citeproc{ref-vonwachter2023-defi-phd}{Wachter, 2023};
\citeproc{ref-werner2020-governance-blockchain}{Werner et al., 2020}).

The proposed governance operating model outlines how VIRIDIS can
implement DAO principles through token-based voting, transparent
dashboards, and phased adoption. The business case demonstrates that
this model is financially viable, generating new revenue streams through
V-GTI and V-ECO initiatives while achieving cost savings and efficiency
gains. Scenario analysis shows resilience in best, normal, and
worst-case conditions
(\citeproc{ref-viridis2025-financial-report}{VIRIDIS, 2025a}).

The conclusion of the thesis is that decentralisation offers VIRIDIS a
viable and competitive governance model that both secures long-term
survival and strengthens its position as a leader in sustainable
innovation. By adopting this model, VIRIDIS can attract more investors,
increase stakeholder participation, and channel more capital into green
technology projects that contribute to European and global
sustainability goals.

\chapter{1. Context and Problem Definition}\label{sec-context}

\section{1.1 Company Overview: VIRIDIS}\label{sec-company}

VIRIDIS Green Tech Investment AG is a European company founded in 2022
with the mission of accelerating the transition toward a sustainable and
climate-neutral economy. Positioned at the intersection of innovation,
sustainability, and finance, VIRIDIS develops projects in clean energy,
circular bioeconomy solutions, and environmentally responsible
technologies. Its long-term vision explicitly aligns with the European
Green Deal, the Paris Agreement, and the UN Sustainable Development
Goals
(\citeproc{ref-european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth}{Commission,
2019}).

VIRIDIS operates as a \textbf{digital cooperative ecosystem}, structured
around two entities:\\
- \textbf{V-GTI (VIRIDIS Green Tech Investment AG)} focuses on
investment strategy, capital allocation, and portfolio development.\\
- \textbf{V-ECO (VIRIDIS Eco-System gGmbH)} acts as the non-profit
branch supporting incubation, education, and community initiatives.

The company issues the \textbf{VIA Security Token}, built on blockchain
infrastructure, which grants both financial participation and governance
rights through a DAO mechanism. Token holders are able to vote on
strategic decisions and benefit from transparent distribution of
profits, positioning VIRIDIS as a first mover in sustainable finance
(\citeproc{ref-viridis2025-strategy}{VIRIDIS, 2025b},
\citeproc{ref-viridis2025-financial-report}{2025a}).

Despite its innovative approach, VIRIDIS faces persistent capital
mobilisation challenges. Institutional and private funding has been slow
to scale, leaving the company reliant on phased fundraising rounds
(``Build, Fuel, Fly'') targeting a total of €8 million in growth capital
(\citeproc{ref-viridis2025-investment}{VIRIDIS, 2025c}). Without
successfully addressing governance gaps and investor concerns, VIRIDIS
risks losing momentum in the rapidly expanding sustainable finance
market.

\section{1.2 Stakeholder Mapping}\label{sec-stakeholders}

VIRIDIS has developed a diverse ecosystem of internal and external
stakeholders. These include founders, board members, employees, token
investors, start-up partners, regulators, and community contributors.
Stakeholders are categorised by \textbf{influence} (decision power) and
\textbf{interest} (engagement level), which allows for a systematic
mapping of roles and expectations.

\emph{Figure placeholder: Stakeholder map of the VIRIDIS ecosystem.}

\subsection{1.2.1 Detailed Classification of Stakeholder
Engagement}\label{sec-stakeholders-class}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Internal Stakeholders (blue nodes)}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Board of Directors (V-GTI and V-ECO) --- strategic oversight and
    investment approval.\\
  \item
    Employees --- project execution and operational activities.\\
  \item
    Token Investors --- financial participants with governance rights
    through DAO voting.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{External Stakeholders (green nodes)}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Regulators and government bodies --- ensure compliance with EU
    taxonomy and financial disclosure rules.\\
  \item
    Strategic Partners --- start-ups and research institutions
    collaborating on green technologies.\\
  \item
    Community members --- participants in incubation programs,
    workshops, and awareness campaigns.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Each stakeholder group is matched to an \textbf{engagement strategy}:
inform, consult, involve, collaborate, or empower. This ensures that
participation mechanisms are designed to reflect the relative salience
of each stakeholder.

\section{1.3 Problem Statement: Governance and Investment
Gap}\label{sec-problem}

VIRIDIS faces a dual challenge that threatens both its immediate
survival and long-term growth:\\
1. \textbf{Insufficient investment} in its portfolio of green technology
projects.\\
2. \textbf{Outdated governance structure} that relies on a centralised,
hierarchical decision-making model.

The current governance setup concentrates authority in a small circle of
board members across V-GTI and V-ECO. While this structure provided
efficiency during the start-up phase, it now creates critical barriers:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Transparency Deficit}: Stakeholders outside the board have
  limited visibility into decision-making processes.\\
\item
  \textbf{Low Inclusivity}: Investors and community members lack
  meaningful influence, undermining engagement and trust.\\
\item
  \textbf{Slow Decision Cycles}: Bureaucratic bottlenecks hinder VIRIDIS
  from rapidly responding to opportunities in the dynamic sustainable
  finance sector.\\
\item
  \textbf{Investor Concerns}: Inadequate participatory mechanisms
  discourage capital inflows from both institutional and retail
  investors, who increasingly demand accountability and verifiable
  governance practices
  (\citeproc{ref-aghion1997-decentralization}{Aghion \& Tirole, 1997};
  \citeproc{ref-viridis2025-financial-report}{VIRIDIS, 2025a}).
\end{itemize}

Without reform, VIRIDIS risks failing to capture the fast-growing pool
of sustainable finance capital. The governance gap thus directly
intersects with the investment gap, creating a feedback loop: limited
trust reduces participation, which in turn limits growth capital,
further eroding credibility.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\section{1.4 Opportunity in Sustainable Finance}\label{sec-opportunity}

The European Union's Green Deal and sustainable finance agenda highlight
the urgency of mobilising private capital to bridge the estimated
\textbf{€175--€290 billion annual investment gap} required to reach
climate neutrality by 2050
(\citeproc{ref-european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth}{Commission,
2019}). Regulations such as the EU Taxonomy, SFDR, and new ESG
disclosure rules create strong incentives for transparent and
accountable investment practices.

For VIRIDIS, this landscape presents a unique opportunity:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Alignment with EU Policy}: By adopting decentralised,
  transparent governance systems, VIRIDIS can demonstrate compliance
  with sustainability disclosure requirements, positioning itself as a
  credible recipient of EU-aligned funding.\\
\item
  \textbf{Investor Attraction}: Capital markets and retail investors are
  actively searching for credible, verifiable green investments. A
  DAO-based model, with real-time dashboards and auditable decision
  records, meets these demands.\\
\item
  \textbf{First-Mover Advantage}: Few European green-tech investment
  firms have operationalised decentralised governance. By doing so,
  VIRIDIS can differentiate itself and build a reputation for
  transparency, accountability, and innovation.\\
\item
  \textbf{Network Effects}: Inclusive governance increases stakeholder
  participation, strengthening trust and expanding the ecosystem. This
  can generate positive feedback loops of engagement and investment.
\end{itemize}

In short, while governance inefficiencies are a barrier, they also
represent an opportunity: reforming governance can unlock capital flows,
enhance competitiveness, and align VIRIDIS with broader EU sustainable
finance transformations
(\citeproc{ref-kellers2022-mobilizing-capital}{Kellers, 2022};
\citeproc{ref-vonwachter2023-defi-phd}{Wachter, 2023}).

\section{1.5 Research Questions and Objectives}\label{sec-rq}

\subsection{Research Questions}\label{research-questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Investment Mobilisation}: Does a decentralised governance
  system outperform the current hierarchical model in attracting
  sustainable investment.\\
\item
  \textbf{Stakeholder Engagement}: Does inclusive decision-making
  stimulate higher levels of stakeholder participation across VIRIDIS
  projects, thereby strengthening network effects.\\
\item
  \textbf{Green Capital Allocation}: Does decentralised governance
  specifically channel more capital into \textbf{green technology
  investments} rather than general technology ventures.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research Objectives}\label{research-objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Analyse the shortcomings of the current governance framework and
  identify critical transparency and participation gaps.\\
\item
  Evaluate decentralised governance designs (DAO models) in light of
  VIRIDIS's operational constraints and EU sustainable finance
  expectations.\\
\item
  Map and classify stakeholders to understand their incentives,
  salience, and preferred modes of engagement.\\
\item
  Prototype decentralised governance mechanisms (token-based voting,
  transparent dashboards, iterative feedback loops) and test them with
  direct and indirect stakeholders.\\
\item
  Construct a \textbf{multi-value business case} demonstrating financial
  viability, impact alignment, and strategic competitiveness.\\
\item
  Provide a phased \textbf{implementation roadmap} that enables VIRIDIS
  to transition toward decentralised governance while maintaining
  regulatory compliance and scalability.
\end{enumerate}

By addressing these questions and objectives, the research aims to
demonstrate how a carefully designed DAO-enabled governance system can
close both the governance and investment gaps, positioning VIRIDIS as a
frontrunner in sustainable innovation and finance.

\chapter{2. Context Analysis}\label{sec-context-analysis}

\section{2.1 External Environment: EU Sustainable Finance and Green
Deal}\label{sec-eu}

The European Green Deal establishes a policy framework for achieving
climate neutrality by 2050. A critical component of this framework is
\textbf{sustainable finance}, which integrates environmental, social,
and governance (ESG) considerations into investment decisions. According
to the European Commission, Europe requires \textbf{€175--€290 billion
in additional yearly investment} to meet its 2030 and 2050 climate and
energy goals
(\citeproc{ref-european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth}{Commission,
2019}).

Three flagship regulations shape the financial environment:\\
- \textbf{EU Taxonomy}: a classification system defining which economic
activities qualify as sustainable.\\
- \textbf{Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)}: obliges
financial institutions to disclose sustainability risks and impacts.\\
- \textbf{Climate Benchmarks and ESG Disclosures}: ensure comparability
and alignment with the Paris Agreement.

For VIRIDIS, this environment presents both constraints and
opportunities. Constraints arise from stricter compliance and reporting
demands. Opportunities lie in \textbf{capital flows redirected to
verifiable sustainable projects}, particularly those with transparent
governance and traceable impact.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\section{2.2 Industry Trends in Governance Models}\label{sec-trends}

Industry governance models are undergoing significant change due to
digital transformation and sustainability imperatives. Two overarching
trends stand out:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Platformisation}: Governance in digital platforms emphasises
  coordination, openness, and resource sharing. Blockchain-based
  platforms extend this by reducing reliance on intermediaries and
  shifting trust toward the protocol itself
  (\citeproc{ref-werner2020-governance-blockchain}{Werner et al.,
  2020}).\\
\item
  \textbf{Decentralisation}: Distributed ledger technologies enable
  \textbf{Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)} that coordinate
  activities through transparent, programmable rules rather than
  hierarchical structures (\citeproc{ref-atzori2018-trust-chain}{Atzori,
  2018}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2.2.1 Cross-cutting Technical and Institutional
Trends}\label{sec-trends-cross}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Transparency and Traceability}: Regulators and investors
  demand verifiable reporting and auditable governance.\\
\item
  \textbf{Programmability and Automation}: Smart contracts allow rules
  to be enforced automatically, reducing administrative overhead.\\
\item
  \textbf{Stakeholder Inclusion}: Decentralised models encourage wider
  participation, improving legitimacy and resilience
  (\citeproc{ref-aghion1997-decentralization}{Aghion \& Tirole,
  1997}).\\
\item
  \textbf{Regulatory Alignment}: Adoption is shaped by EU disclosure
  requirements and ESG benchmarks.\\
\item
  \textbf{Institutional Experimentation}: Firms experiment with hybrid
  models combining traditional oversight with decentralised
  participation to balance compliance and innovation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{2.3 Benchmarking Traditional vs Decentralized
Governance}\label{sec-benchmark}

Traditional governance relies on hierarchical oversight, while
decentralised governance distributes authority across tokenised or
participatory systems. Benchmarking reveals fundamental differences:

regulation creates compliance uncertainty.

\textbf{Opportunities}\\
- \textbf{Capital Mobilisation}: alignment with EU sustainable finance
frameworks positions VIRIDIS as a credible investment destination
(\citeproc{ref-kellers2022-mobilizing-capital}{Kellers, 2022}).\\
- \textbf{Innovation}: decentralised governance fosters rapid
experimentation and idea generation.\\
- \textbf{Competitive Differentiation}: by adopting DAO principles,
VIRIDIS can establish itself as a frontrunner in sustainable finance and
governance innovation.

\chapter{3. Scope and Limitations}\label{sec-scope}

\section{3.1 Scope of the Project}\label{sec-in}

The scope of this project is the \textbf{design, analysis, and
validation} of a decentralised governance model for VIRIDIS. The project
specifically focuses on how governance reform can support capital
mobilisation and improve stakeholder participation within the company's
sustainable finance ecosystem.

The work includes:\\
- A comprehensive analysis of the \textbf{current governance structure}
of VIRIDIS.\\
- A \textbf{stakeholder mapping and classification} to identify
incentives and engagement mechanisms.\\
- The application of ideation and design methods (SCAMPER, heatmaps,
iteration rounds) to generate solution concepts.\\
- The \textbf{design of a DAO-enabled operating model}, including
token-based voting, transparent dashboards, and rule-setting
mechanisms.\\
- Testing through \textbf{prototyping, workshops, and feedback loops}
with both direct and indirect stakeholders.\\
- Development of a \textbf{multi-value business case} that covers
financial, technological, and societal dimensions.\\
- A \textbf{phased implementation roadmap} aligned with EU sustainable
finance frameworks and VIRIDIS's growth strategy.

\section{3.2 Out of Scope}\label{sec-out}

Several areas fall outside the scope of this report to maintain focus
and feasibility:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Full-scale technical implementation}: while prototypes are
  developed, a production-ready blockchain infrastructure is outside the
  scope.\\
\item
  \textbf{Policy design beyond EU frameworks}: global regulatory
  harmonisation is acknowledged but not addressed in detail.\\
\item
  \textbf{Non-financial performance of portfolio startups}: the emphasis
  is on governance and capital mobilisation rather than sectoral
  technology outcomes.\\
\item
  \textbf{Long-term macroeconomic forecasting}: while scenarios are
  explored, full predictive modelling of global markets is excluded.\\
\item
  \textbf{Legal adjudication}: the report does not provide binding legal
  interpretations of DAO or token regulation.
\end{itemize}

\section{3.3 Limitations}\label{sec-limits}

This study is subject to several limitations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Single-case design}: focusing on VIRIDIS limits
  generalisability to other firms, though findings may have broader
  relevance.\\
\item
  \textbf{Time-bound research}: the report is based on a one-year
  project window, restricting longitudinal analysis of governance
  impacts.\\
\item
  \textbf{Stakeholder sampling}: while both direct and indirect
  stakeholders were consulted, the number of participants was
  constrained by availability and project scope.\\
\item
  \textbf{Prototype fidelity}: prototypes used in workshops are
  simplified representations and may not capture all technical
  complexities of DAO systems.\\
\item
  \textbf{Regulatory uncertainty}: EU frameworks are evolving, meaning
  that assumptions made in this study could shift as new laws and
  guidelines are introduced.
\end{itemize}

Despite these limitations, the study provides a robust foundation for
evaluating the viability of decentralised governance at VIRIDIS and for
informing further development.

\chapter{4. Problem Analysis and Research}\label{sec-analysis}

\section{4.1 Current Governance Setup}\label{sec-current-gov}

VIRIDIS currently employs a \textbf{dual-entity governance structure}:\\
- \textbf{V-GTI (VIRIDIS Green Tech Investment AG)} is the for-profit
entity responsible for raising capital, managing investments, and
steering strategic decision-making.\\
- \textbf{V-ECO (VIRIDIS Eco-System gGmbH)} is the non-profit branch
focused on incubation, education, and community engagement.

While this structure reflects the company's hybrid mission of generating
both economic and social value, it suffers from several inefficiencies:
overlapping board membership, centralisation of authority, and lack of
transparent communication with broader stakeholders. These issues have a
direct impact on investor confidence, stakeholder trust, and overall
scalability.

\subsection{4.1.1 Structure and Oversight}\label{sec-oversight}

The oversight system is highly centralised, with decision-making
concentrated in the boards of V-GTI and V-ECO. Key characteristics
include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Board Overlap}: Many directors sit on both boards, reducing
  diversity of perspectives and concentrating power.\\
\item
  \textbf{Hierarchical Decision Flow}: Strategic initiatives require
  approval from a small executive group, delaying responsiveness.\\
\item
  \textbf{Accountability Gaps}: Oversight mechanisms are internally
  managed, limiting external visibility into governance outcomes.
\end{itemize}

This structural design ensures control but weakens inclusivity. For a
firm competing in the sustainable finance domain, where transparency and
participation are critical, the current model undermines alignment with
investor and regulatory expectations.

\subsection{4.1.2 Talent and Culture}\label{sec-culture}

The cultural environment within VIRIDIS is shaped by its early-stage
entrepreneurial context. The team demonstrates strong \textbf{commitment
to sustainability and innovation}, yet several challenges have been
identified:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Centralised Decision Culture}: Employees and mid-level
  managers have limited input into strategic choices, which reduces
  engagement and slows innovation.\\
\item
  \textbf{Participation Barriers}: Community members and token investors
  lack clear mechanisms to contribute ideas or influence governance.\\
\item
  \textbf{Trust Deficit}: Stakeholder interviews conducted during GP2
  revealed concerns about transparency and inclusivity, particularly
  among external partners and investors.
\end{itemize}

A decentralised governance system could help shift this culture toward
one of \textbf{shared ownership, accountability, and innovation},
thereby increasing both trust and productivity.

\subsection{4.1.3 Infrastructure and Technology}\label{sec-it}

The current technological infrastructure of VIRIDIS supports core
operations but lacks integrated systems for decentralised participation.
Identified issues include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Fragmented IT Systems}: Governance and investment processes
  are supported by traditional digital tools but not by
  blockchain-enabled platforms.\\
\item
  \textbf{Limited Transparency Tools}: Reporting is largely periodic and
  static, falling short of the real-time traceability expected by
  sustainable finance stakeholders.\\
\item
  \textbf{No On-Chain Governance}: The VIA Security Token exists
  primarily as a financial instrument; its governance functionalities
  (e.g., voting rights) are not fully operationalised.
\end{itemize}

These limitations highlight the need for a \textbf{blockchain-based
governance infrastructure} with features such as:\\
- Token-weighted voting.\\
- Smart contract--based rules and accountability.\\
- Dashboards for real-time transparency and monitoring.

Together, these reforms can transform the VIRIDIS governance model into
one that aligns with EU regulatory expectations and investor preferences
for transparent, auditable systems.

\section{4.2 Assessment of Gaps in Decision-Making and
Inclusion}\label{sec-gaps}

The assessment of governance practices at VIRIDIS reveals a set of
critical gaps in decision-making and inclusion. These gaps directly
undermine the firm's ability to mobilise capital, build trust, and align
with sustainable finance expectations.

\subsection{4.2.1 Hierarchical Limitations}\label{sec-hier}

The current governance structure is hierarchical and centralised, with
most decision-making power concentrated at the executive and board
levels. This creates several problems:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Bureaucratic Bottlenecks}: Decisions require multiple layers
  of approval, leading to delays in fast-moving markets.\\
\item
  \textbf{Concentration of Authority}: A small circle of board members
  holds disproportionate influence, reducing diversity of
  perspectives.\\
\item
  \textbf{Low Stakeholder Agency}: Employees, token investors, and
  community members have limited or no role in shaping strategic
  initiatives.
\end{itemize}

These limitations restrict VIRIDIS's responsiveness to emerging
opportunities in the green-tech sector and diminish the inclusivity
needed for stakeholder trust.

\subsection{4.2.2 Transparency and Communication Gaps}\label{sec-comm}

A consistent theme from stakeholder feedback is the lack of transparency
in governance processes. Identified gaps include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Opaque Decision Processes}: Stakeholders outside the board
  cannot trace how or why strategic decisions are made.\\
\item
  \textbf{Irregular Communication}: Reporting is periodic and often
  delayed, limiting the availability of up-to-date information.\\
\item
  \textbf{Perceived Exclusion}: Investors and community members perceive
  governance as a closed process, which discourages engagement and
  weakens credibility.
\end{itemize}

This gap contrasts sharply with EU sustainable finance regulations,
which demand auditable and verifiable disclosures. Without improvement,
VIRIDIS risks failing to meet both regulatory requirements and investor
expectations.

\subsection{4.2.3 Technology Adoption Challenges}\label{sec-tech-chal}

Although VIRIDIS has introduced the VIA Security Token,
governance-related technology adoption remains incomplete. Key
challenges include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Underutilised Token Functionality}: VIA is primarily used as a
  financial instrument; its governance potential (voting rights,
  proposal systems) has not been fully activated.\\
\item
  \textbf{Lack of Integrated Dashboards}: No unified platform exists to
  display governance events, voting outcomes, or project progress in
  real time.\\
\item
  \textbf{Limited Experimentation}: Prototypes for decentralised tools
  are still in early testing stages, preventing broader adoption and
  learning.
\end{itemize}

The absence of robust technological infrastructure prevents the company
from operationalising decentralised governance and realising its
benefits. As a result, investor trust, stakeholder participation, and
regulatory alignment remain below potential.

\textbf{Summary}\\
The combined effect of hierarchical limitations, transparency deficits,
and incomplete technology adoption creates a governance gap that
directly constrains investment mobilisation. Addressing these gaps
through decentralised, DAO-enabled governance mechanisms is essential
for VIRIDIS to achieve credibility, scalability, and alignment with EU
sustainable finance frameworks.

\chapter{5. Stakeholder Analysis, Mapping, and
Engagement}\label{sec-engagement}

\section{5.1 Identification of Key Stakeholders}\label{sec-ident}

The VIRIDIS ecosystem brings together a diverse set of stakeholders,
both internal and external, who influence and are affected by governance
outcomes. Based on interviews, document analysis, and workshop data, the
following groups are identified:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Internal Stakeholders}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Board of Directors (V-GTI, V-ECO)\\
  \item
    Employees and project managers\\
  \item
    Token investors (VIA holders)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{External Stakeholders}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Strategic partners (start-ups, incubated ventures, R\&D
    institutions)\\
  \item
    Government and regulatory bodies (EU financial authorities,
    sustainability regulators)\\
  \item
    Community participants (local initiatives, civil society actors,
    sustainability advocates)\\
  \item
    Private and institutional investors
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{5.2 Stakeholder Mapping (Direct and Indirect)}\label{sec-map}

Stakeholders are categorised as \textbf{direct} (actively involved in
governance or operations) or \textbf{indirect} (influenced by governance
decisions but not directly participating).

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}

\end{longtable}

\section{5.3 Engagement Levels and
Classifications}\label{sec-engage-levels}

Each stakeholder group is assigned an engagement strategy, drawing on
the IAP2 framework (inform, consult, involve, collaborate, empower):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Inform}: Regulators and government bodies (transparent
  reporting, compliance updates).\\
\item
  \textbf{Consult}: Institutional investors (feedback on governance, ESG
  alignment).\\
\item
  \textbf{Involve}: Employees and project managers (participation in
  workshops, advisory roles).\\
\item
  \textbf{Collaborate}: Strategic partners and start-ups (joint
  governance initiatives, co-design).\\
\item
  \textbf{Empower}: Token holders and community participants (voting
  rights, proposal mechanisms).
\end{itemize}

This classification ensures that participation mechanisms are calibrated
to the influence, interest, and salience of each stakeholder group.

\section{5.4 Multi-Perspective Change Scenarios}\label{sec-scenarios}

To anticipate governance reforms, VIRIDIS explored multi-perspective
change scenarios with stakeholders. Three key scenarios emerged:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Incremental Reform (Hybrid Model)}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Retains hierarchical oversight but introduces consultative
    mechanisms for token holders and employees.\\
  \item
    Low risk, but limited transformative impact on transparency and
    trust.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Participatory DAO (Phased Rollout)}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Gradually expands decision-making rights to token holders and
    community members.\\
  \item
    Uses pilots and prototypes to test dashboards, voting, and proposal
    systems.\\
  \item
    Balances compliance with inclusivity.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Full DAO Transition}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Transfers significant decision rights to a decentralised governance
    system.\\
  \item
    Maximises transparency, accountability, and stakeholder inclusion.\\
  \item
    Carries higher regulatory and cultural risks, but also greater
    potential for differentiation and innovation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

These scenarios reflect the range of possible pathways for VIRIDIS, from
cautious adaptation to bold transformation. Stakeholder input
consistently emphasised the importance of a \textbf{phased approach},
starting with hybrid models and scaling toward decentralised governance
as trust and capability grow.

\chapter{6. Solution Design and Development}\label{sec-solution}

\section{6.2 Gap Analysis from GP3 Research}\label{sec-gap-res}

The findings from GP3 research highlight three central governance gaps
at VIRIDIS:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Decision-Making}: Overly centralised authority restricts
  agility and responsiveness.\\
\item
  \textbf{Transparency}: Lack of real-time reporting and limited
  stakeholder visibility reduce trust.\\
\item
  \textbf{Inclusion}: Investors, employees, and community members have
  insufficient voice in shaping strategy.
\end{itemize}

Workshops and interviews confirmed that these gaps translate into lower
participation rates, weak investor confidence, and limited capital
inflow. Addressing them requires an operating model that distributes
authority, leverages technology for transparency, and expands
participation beyond the board level.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\section{6.3 Ideation Process and Design Criteria}\label{sec-ideation}

The ideation process applied a structured design-thinking approach
supported by the SCAMPER framework. Stakeholders were invited to
co-create solutions through workshops and brainstorming sessions. Three
design criteria guided the process:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Inclusivity}: Broaden participation by embedding mechanisms
  for token holders, employees, and partners.\\
\item
  \textbf{Transparency}: Provide real-time, verifiable reporting of
  decisions and outcomes.\\
\item
  \textbf{Feasibility}: Ensure proposed solutions are technically
  implementable and align with EU regulatory frameworks.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{6.3.1 Iteration Round 1: Idea Generation}\label{sec-it1}

In the first ideation round, participants generated a broad set of
potential solutions. Key ideas included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Token-weighted voting} using the VIA Security Token.\\
\item
  \textbf{Transparent dashboards} displaying governance events and
  financial flows.\\
\item
  \textbf{Delegated voting mechanisms} to increase efficiency while
  maintaining inclusivity.\\
\item
  \textbf{Smart contract--based rules} for automatic execution of
  governance decisions.\\
\item
  \textbf{Hybrid governance models} combining DAO participation with
  board oversight.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{figs/BrainstormedIdeas.png}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-brainstorm}}

\end{figure}%

These ideas provided the foundation for subsequent evaluation and
prioritisation.

\subsection{6.3.2 Heatmap Analysis and Ratings}\label{sec-heatmap}

To evaluate the feasibility and impact of the brainstormed ideas, a
heatmap analysis was conducted. Stakeholders rated each idea across
three dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Impact}: Potential to improve participation, trust, and
  capital mobilisation.\\
\item
  \textbf{Feasibility}: Technical and organisational implementability in
  the short-to-medium term.\\
\item
  \textbf{Alignment}: Fit with EU sustainable finance frameworks and
  VIRIDIS strategy.
\end{itemize}

Delegated voting & Medium & Medium & Medium & 6.5 \\
Smart contract rules & High & Medium & High & 8.0 \\
Hybrid DAO-board governance & Medium & High & High & 8.0 \\
\end{longtable}

The results indicate that \textbf{transparent dashboards} and
\textbf{token-weighted voting} emerged as the most impactful and
feasible starting points. Smart contract rules and hybrid governance
models were also prioritised for phased implementation, while delegated
voting was considered less urgent.

\subsection{6.3.3 Iteration Round 2}\label{sec-it2}

In the second iteration, the shortlisted ideas from the heatmap were
refined with stakeholder feedback. Prototypes of dashboards and mock-ups
of voting flows were presented in workshops. Key developments included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Dashboard Prototype}: A visual interface showing proposals,
  voting outcomes, and financial flows in real time.\\
\item
  \textbf{Voting Flow Simulation}: Token holders simulated casting votes
  on pilot decisions using mock tokens.\\
\item
  \textbf{Risk Mitigation Discussions}: Stakeholders raised concerns
  about regulatory compliance, prompting the addition of oversight
  features.
\end{itemize}

Stakeholder ratings in this round confirmed the need for a phased
rollout, beginning with dashboards and voting, followed by more advanced
smart contract automation.

\subsection{6.3.4 Iteration Round 3: Final Selection}\label{sec-it3}

The third iteration focused on consolidation. Participants compared
refined solutions and voted on the final design package. The following
elements were selected:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Core Features}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Token-weighted voting (VIA Security Token).\\
  \item
    Transparent dashboards for proposals and outcomes.\\
  \item
    Governance rules embedded in smart contracts for accountability.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Supporting Features}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Delegated voting as an optional efficiency tool.\\
  \item
    Hybrid oversight to balance board authority with DAO participation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{figs/ScamperIdeationAppliedToViridis.png}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-scamper}}

\end{figure}%

These features formed the basis of the optimal innovation solution for
VIRIDIS.

\section{6.4 Optimal Innovation Solution}\label{sec-optimal}

The optimal solution is a \textbf{DAO-enabled governance model} that
integrates decentralised participation with transparent oversight
mechanisms. Its key characteristics include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Inclusive Participation}: All VIA token holders can vote on
  strategic proposals.\\
\item
  \textbf{Transparency}: Real-time dashboards display proposals, voting
  outcomes, and financial allocations.\\
\item
  \textbf{Programmability}: Smart contracts enforce governance rules
  automatically, reducing manipulation risk.\\
\item
  \textbf{Hybrid Oversight}: The board retains a supervisory role,
  ensuring compliance with EU regulations.
\end{itemize}

This solution directly addresses VIRIDIS's governance gaps by broadening
stakeholder engagement, increasing transparency, and mobilising
investment capital.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{figs/ViridisGovernanceOperatingModel.png}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-viridis-model}}

\end{figure}%

\section{GP4 Solution Implementation}\label{sec-gp4}

\subsection{6.5.1 Technical Design (Voting, Token,
Dashboard)}\label{sec-tech}

The technical implementation plan builds on three modules:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Voting Mechanism}: Token-weighted voting integrated into the
  VIA Security Token smart contract.\\
\item
  \textbf{Governance Dashboard}: Web-based interface showing proposals,
  votes, and outcomes.\\
\item
  \textbf{Smart Contracts}: Automated enforcement of governance rules,
  including quorum thresholds and veto options.
\end{enumerate}

The system is designed for gradual rollout, starting with advisory votes
before moving to binding governance decisions.

\subsection{6.5.2 Governance Structure and Rules}\label{sec-structure}

The governance framework defines responsibilities and safeguards:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Proposal Submission}: Token holders and board members can
  submit proposals.\\
\item
  \textbf{Voting Rules}: Decisions require quorum and majority
  thresholds defined in smart contracts.\\
\item
  \textbf{Delegated Voting}: Optional mechanism for efficiency, allowing
  token holders to delegate votes.\\
\item
  \textbf{Oversight Layer}: The board retains veto power over proposals
  that conflict with legal or regulatory requirements.\\
\item
  \textbf{Audit and Traceability}: All actions are logged on-chain for
  transparency and accountability.
\end{itemize}

This structure balances decentralisation with the compliance and
stability required by EU regulators.

\section{6.6 Implications for VIRIDIS}\label{sec-implications-viridis}

Adopting this DAO-enabled governance model has several implications:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Strategic}: Positions VIRIDIS as a pioneer in sustainable
  finance governance, differentiating it in the European market.\\
\item
  \textbf{Financial}: Enhanced transparency and inclusion increase
  investor confidence, mobilising additional capital flows.\\
\item
  \textbf{Cultural}: Shifts organisational culture toward participation,
  accountability, and innovation.\\
\item
  \textbf{Regulatory}: Aligns governance practices with EU disclosure
  frameworks while retaining oversight mechanisms to mitigate legal
  uncertainty.\\
\item
  \textbf{Scalability}: Creates a governance infrastructure capable of
  growing with VIRIDIS's ecosystem, supporting future expansion into
  global markets.
\end{itemize}

The transition to this model requires careful implementation but offers
transformative potential in addressing both the governance and
investment gaps at VIRIDIS.

\chapter{7. Validation and Testing}\label{sec-validation}

\section{7.1 Prototyping (Dashboard, Token Voting
Flow)}\label{sec-prototype}

Prototypes were developed to test the functionality and usability of
decentralised governance tools. Two main prototypes were created:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Governance Dashboard}: A web interface displaying proposals,
  live voting outcomes, and project metrics.\\
\item
  \textbf{Token Voting Flow}: A simulation of VIA Security Token--based
  voting, allowing participants to cast votes and see results reflected
  on the dashboard.
\end{itemize}

These prototypes demonstrated the feasibility of integrating
blockchain-based decision-making with user-friendly interfaces.

\section{7.2 Pilot Workshops and Feedback Loops}\label{sec-workshops}

Pilot workshops were conducted with selected employees, token holders,
and partners. Participants interacted with the prototypes and provided
feedback on:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Usability}: Interface clarity, ease of navigation, and voting
  mechanics.\\
\item
  \textbf{Trust}: Perceived transparency of decision-making processes.\\
\item
  \textbf{Functionality}: Adequacy of reporting features and proposal
  tracking.
\end{itemize}

Feedback loops were integrated by iteratively refining the prototypes
after each workshop session. This ensured progressive improvement and
alignment with stakeholder expectations.

\section{7.3 Validation with Direct Stakeholders}\label{sec-direct}

Direct stakeholders --- including board members, employees, and token
investors --- were engaged to validate the prototypes against strategic
goals. Key findings:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Board members valued the retention of oversight mechanisms and veto
  functions.\\
\item
  Employees appreciated improved visibility into governance processes.\\
\item
  Token investors expressed increased trust in transparent, auditable
  voting mechanisms.
\end{itemize}

\section{7.4 Validation with Indirect Stakeholders and
Non-Users}\label{sec-indirect}

Indirect stakeholders, such as regulators, institutional investors, and

\chapter{8. Multi-Value Business Case}\label{sec-business-case}

\section{8.1 Financial Analysis}\label{sec-financial}

The financial analysis of the DAO-enabled governance model focuses on
setup costs, operational costs, and efficiency gains. Data is drawn from
the VIRIDIS financial reports and projections
(\citeproc{ref-viridis2025-financial-report}{VIRIDIS, 2025a}).

\subsection{8.1.1 Initial Setup Costs (CAPEX)}\label{sec-capex}

Initial capital expenditures are required to establish the decentralised
governance infrastructure. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Blockchain Infrastructure}: deployment of smart contracts,
  token integration, and security audits.\\
\item
  \textbf{Dashboard Development}: design and implementation of
  governance and reporting interfaces.\\
\item
  \textbf{Training and Onboarding}: workshops for employees, investors,
  and community members.\\
\item
  \textbf{Legal and Compliance Services}: ensuring EU regulatory
  alignment for tokenisation and DAO structures.
\end{itemize}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lr@{}}

\end{longtable}

\subsection{8.1.3 Cost Savings and Efficiency Gains}\label{sec-savings}

The decentralised governance model generates cost savings and efficiency
gains compared to the current hierarchical model:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Reduced Administrative Overhead}: automation of reporting and
  voting reduces manual effort.\\
\item
  \textbf{Faster Decision Cycles}: shorter approval chains reduce
  delays, leading to opportunity gains.\\
\item
  \textbf{Investor Confidence}: higher transparency attracts more
  investment, reducing fundraising costs.
\end{itemize}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lr@{}}
\caption{Estimated annual cost savings and efficiency
gains}\label{tbl-savings}\tabularnewline

\end{longtable}

These figures suggest that after covering CAPEX and OPEX, the
DAO-enabled governance model begins to generate net positive financial
value within the projected payback period (see §8.3).

\section{8.2 Revenue Streams}\label{sec-revenue}

In addition to efficiency gains, the DAO-enabled governance model
creates new and diversified revenue opportunities across VIRIDIS's two
entities: V-GTI (Green Tech Investment AG) and V-ECO (Eco-System gGmbH).
Together, these streams enhance financial sustainability and strengthen
the multi-value proposition.

\subsection{8.2.1 V-GTI Revenue Generation}\label{sec-vgti}

V-GTI, as the for-profit arm, generates revenue through investment
activities and service offerings. Under the decentralised governance
model, revenue streams include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

\end{longtable}

\subsection{8.2.2 V-ECO Revenue Generation}\label{sec-veco}

V-ECO, as the non-profit entity, primarily focuses on community
engagement, incubation, and ecosystem building. While its mission is
impact-driven, it also generates income to support its sustainability:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Donations and Grants}: funding from foundations, EU programs,
  and sustainability initiatives.\\
\item
  \textbf{Educational Programs}: fees from workshops, training, and
  university collaborations.\\
\item
  \textbf{Event Management}: revenue from hosting networking events,
  hackathons, and conferences.\\
\item
  \textbf{Consulting and Support Services}: assisting start-ups in ESG
  alignment, compliance, and circular economy integration.\\
\item
  \textbf{Partnership Contributions}: co-financing from strategic
  partners for ecosystem development projects.
\end{itemize}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lr@{}}

\end{longtable}

Together, V-GTI and V-ECO form a \textbf{dual revenue model}: V-GTI
drives financial return on investment, while V-ECO generates social
impact revenues. This combination strengthens VIRIDIS's ability to
deliver both economic and societal value within a decentralised
governance framework. \#\# 8.3 Financial Model and Payback Period
\{\#sec-payback\}

The financial model integrates CAPEX, OPEX, cost savings, and projected
revenues. The aim is to estimate the \textbf{payback period} of the
DAO-enabled governance system.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{CAPEX} (one-time): €625,000 (§8.1.1).\\
\item
  \textbf{OPEX} (annual): €210,000 (§8.1.2).\\
\item
  \textbf{Annual Savings}: €300,000 (§8.1.3).\\
\item
  \textbf{Revenue Growth}: driven by V-GTI and V-ECO (§8.2).
\end{itemize}

The model suggests that breakeven is achievable within \textbf{3--4
years}, depending on the growth rate of revenue streams and realisation
of efficiency gains.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Expand dashboard access to external stakeholders (investors,
    partners).\\
  \item
    Introduce binding token-weighted votes for defined decision
    categories.\\
  \item
    Begin real-time publication of governance events and outcomes.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Phase 4: Full DAO Governance (2027 and beyond)}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Token holders empowered to propose and vote on strategic
    initiatives.\\
  \item
    Automated smart contract enforcement of governance rules.\\
