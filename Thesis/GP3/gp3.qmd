# Executive Summary

VIRIDIS is a European company active in the green technology sector. To survive and grow, the company must attract significantly more investment in sustainable projects. The current governance model is hierarchical and centralised, which creates barriers in transparency, inclusivity, and stakeholder engagement. These barriers limit trust from investors, restrict employee and partner participation, and weaken VIRIDIS’s ability to capture opportunities in the fast-growing sustainable finance market [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth].

This thesis investigates whether a decentralised governance system can provide a better alternative to the traditional model. It is guided by three central research questions. First, is a decentralised governance system more effective than a traditional one in increasing investment and participation rates. Second, does inclusion in decision-making stimulate active stakeholder engagement in other VIRIDIS projects, thereby strengthening the network effect. Third, does a decentralised governance model specifically direct more capital into green technology rather than general technology.

The research is conducted as a single-case study of VIRIDIS, with its governance transition as the primary unit of analysis. Sector-wide transformations and macroeconomic frameworks including the European Green Deal, the EU Taxonomy, and global sustainable finance initiatives are addressed only as contextual background to situate VIRIDIS’s challenges and opportunities. This ensures the study remains focused on VIRIDIS while acknowledging the broader policy and market landscape in which the company operates.

The study draws on theory from blockchain governance, decentralised finance, and sustainable finance, combined with practical research methods such as stakeholder analysis, ideation sessions, iteration rounds, and prototype testing. Findings suggest that a tailored DAO model can address the key governance gaps of VIRIDIS. Decentralised decision-making improves transparency, builds trust, and creates incentives for wider participation, while aligning the company with European frameworks such as the Green Deal, EU Taxonomy, and ESG disclosure rules [@werner2020-governance-blockchain; @tkachuk2023-efficient-design; @vonwachter2023-defi-phd].

The proposed governance operating model outlines how VIRIDIS can implement DAO principles through token-based voting, transparent dashboards, and phased adoption. The business case demonstrates that this model is financially viable, generating new revenue streams through V-GTI and V-ECO initiatives while achieving cost savings and efficiency gains. Scenario analysis shows resilience in best, normal, and worst-case conditions [@viridis2025-financial-report].

The conclusion of the thesis is that decentralisation offers VIRIDIS a viable and competitive governance model that both secures long-term survival and strengthens its position as a leader in sustainable innovation. By adopting this model, VIRIDIS can attract more investors, increase stakeholder participation, and channel more capital into green technology projects that contribute to European and global sustainability goals.

# 1. Context and Problem Definition {#sec-context}

## 1.1 Company Overview: VIRIDIS {#sec-company}

VIRIDIS Green Tech Investment AG is a European company founded in 2022 with the mission of accelerating the transition toward a sustainable and climate-neutral economy. Positioned at the intersection of innovation, sustainability, and finance, VIRIDIS develops projects in clean energy, circular bioeconomy solutions, and environmentally responsible technologies. Its long-term vision explicitly aligns with the European Green Deal, the Paris Agreement, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth].

VIRIDIS operates as a **digital cooperative ecosystem**, structured around two entities:\
- **V-GTI (VIRIDIS Green Tech Investment AG)** focuses on investment strategy, capital allocation, and portfolio development.\
- **V-ECO (VIRIDIS Eco-System gGmbH)** acts as the non-profit branch supporting incubation, education, and community initiatives.

The company issues the **VIA Security Token**, built on blockchain infrastructure, which grants both financial participation and governance rights through a DAO mechanism. Token holders are able to vote on strategic decisions and benefit from transparent distribution of profits, positioning VIRIDIS as a first mover in sustainable finance [@viridis2025-strategy; @viridis2025-financial-report].

Despite its innovative approach, VIRIDIS faces persistent capital mobilisation challenges. Institutional and private funding has been slow to scale, leaving the company reliant on phased fundraising rounds (“Build, Fuel, Fly”) targeting a total of €8 million in growth capital [@viridis2025-investment]. Without successfully addressing governance gaps and investor concerns, VIRIDIS risks losing momentum in the rapidly expanding sustainable finance market.

## 1.2 Stakeholder Mapping {#sec-stakeholders}

VIRIDIS has developed a diverse ecosystem of internal and external stakeholders. These include founders, board members, employees, token investors, start-up partners, regulators, and community contributors. Stakeholders are categorised by **influence** (decision power) and **interest** (engagement level), which allows for a systematic mapping of roles and expectations.

*Figure placeholder: Stakeholder map of the VIRIDIS ecosystem.*

### 1.2.1 Detailed Classification of Stakeholder Engagement {#sec-stakeholders-class}

-   **Internal Stakeholders (blue nodes)**:
    -   Board of Directors (V-GTI and V-ECO) — strategic oversight and investment approval.\
    -   Employees — project execution and operational activities.\
    -   Token Investors — financial participants with governance rights through DAO voting.
-   **External Stakeholders (green nodes)**:
    -   Regulators and government bodies — ensure compliance with EU taxonomy and financial disclosure rules.\
    -   Strategic Partners — start-ups and research institutions collaborating on green technologies.\
    -   Community members — participants in incubation programs, workshops, and awareness campaigns.

Each stakeholder group is matched to an **engagement strategy**: inform, consult, involve, collaborate, or empower. This ensures that participation mechanisms are designed to reflect the relative salience of each stakeholder.

## 1.3 Problem Statement: Governance and Investment Gap {#sec-problem}

VIRIDIS faces a dual challenge that threatens both its immediate survival and long-term growth:\
1. **Insufficient investment** in its portfolio of green technology projects.\
2. **Outdated governance structure** that relies on a centralised, hierarchical decision-making model.

The current governance setup concentrates authority in a small circle of board members across V-GTI and V-ECO. While this structure provided efficiency during the start-up phase, it now creates critical barriers:

-   **Transparency Deficit**: Stakeholders outside the board have limited visibility into decision-making processes.\
-   **Low Inclusivity**: Investors and community members lack meaningful influence, undermining engagement and trust.\
-   **Slow Decision Cycles**: Bureaucratic bottlenecks hinder VIRIDIS from rapidly responding to opportunities in the dynamic sustainable finance sector.\
-   **Investor Concerns**: Inadequate participatory mechanisms discourage capital inflows from both institutional and retail investors, who increasingly demand accountability and verifiable governance practices [@aghion1997-decentralization; @viridis2025-financial-report].

Without reform, VIRIDIS risks failing to capture the fast-growing pool of sustainable finance capital. The governance gap thus directly intersects with the investment gap, creating a feedback loop: limited trust reduces participation, which in turn limits growth capital, further eroding credibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.4 Opportunity in Sustainable Finance {#sec-opportunity}

The European Union’s Green Deal and sustainable finance agenda highlight the urgency of mobilising private capital to bridge the estimated **€175–€290 billion annual investment gap** required to reach climate neutrality by 2050 [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth]. Regulations such as the EU Taxonomy, SFDR, and new ESG disclosure rules create strong incentives for transparent and accountable investment practices.

For VIRIDIS, this landscape presents a unique opportunity:

-   **Alignment with EU Policy**: By adopting decentralised, transparent governance systems, VIRIDIS can demonstrate compliance with sustainability disclosure requirements, positioning itself as a credible recipient of EU-aligned funding.\
-   **Investor Attraction**: Capital markets and retail investors are actively searching for credible, verifiable green investments. A DAO-based model, with real-time dashboards and auditable decision records, meets these demands.\
-   **First-Mover Advantage**: Few European green-tech investment firms have operationalised decentralised governance. By doing so, VIRIDIS can differentiate itself and build a reputation for transparency, accountability, and innovation.\
-   **Network Effects**: Inclusive governance increases stakeholder participation, strengthening trust and expanding the ecosystem. This can generate positive feedback loops of engagement and investment.

In short, while governance inefficiencies are a barrier, they also represent an opportunity: reforming governance can unlock capital flows, enhance competitiveness, and align VIRIDIS with broader EU sustainable finance transformations [@kellers2022-mobilizing-capital; @vonwachter2023-defi-phd].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.5 Research Questions and Objectives {#sec-rq}

### Research Questions

1.  **Investment Mobilisation**: Does a decentralised governance system outperform the current hierarchical model in attracting sustainable investment.\
2.  **Stakeholder Engagement**: Does inclusive decision-making stimulate higher levels of stakeholder participation across VIRIDIS projects, thereby strengthening network effects.\
3.  **Green Capital Allocation**: Does decentralised governance specifically channel more capital into **green technology investments** rather than general technology ventures.

### Research Objectives

1.  Analyse the shortcomings of the current governance framework and identify critical transparency and participation gaps.\
2.  Evaluate decentralised governance designs (DAO models) in light of VIRIDIS’s operational constraints and EU sustainable finance expectations.\
3.  Map and classify stakeholders to understand their incentives, salience, and preferred modes of engagement.\
4.  Prototype decentralised governance mechanisms (token-based voting, transparent dashboards, iterative feedback loops) and test them with direct and indirect stakeholders.\
5.  Construct a **multi-value business case** demonstrating financial viability, impact alignment, and strategic competitiveness.\
6.  Provide a phased **implementation roadmap** that enables VIRIDIS to transition toward decentralised governance while maintaining regulatory compliance and scalability.

By addressing these questions and objectives, the research aims to demonstrate how a carefully designed DAO-enabled governance system can close both the governance and investment gaps, positioning VIRIDIS as a frontrunner in sustainable innovation and finance.

# 2. Context Analysis {#sec-context-analysis}

## 2.1 External Environment: EU Sustainable Finance and Green Deal {#sec-eu}

The European Green Deal establishes a policy framework for achieving climate neutrality by 2050. A critical component of this framework is **sustainable finance**, which integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into investment decisions. According to the European Commission, Europe requires **€175–€290 billion in additional yearly investment** to meet its 2030 and 2050 climate and energy goals [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth].

Three flagship regulations shape the financial environment:\
- **EU Taxonomy**: a classification system defining which economic activities qualify as sustainable.\
- **Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)**: obliges financial institutions to disclose sustainability risks and impacts.\
- **Climate Benchmarks and ESG Disclosures**: ensure comparability and alignment with the Paris Agreement.

For VIRIDIS, this environment presents both constraints and opportunities. Constraints arise from stricter compliance and reporting demands. Opportunities lie in **capital flows redirected to verifiable sustainable projects**, particularly those with transparent governance and traceable impact.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.2 Industry Trends in Governance Models {#sec-trends}

Industry governance models are undergoing significant change due to digital transformation and sustainability imperatives. Two overarching trends stand out:

-   **Platformisation**: Governance in digital platforms emphasises coordination, openness, and resource sharing. Blockchain-based platforms extend this by reducing reliance on intermediaries and shifting trust toward the protocol itself [@werner2020-governance-blockchain].\
-   **Decentralisation**: Distributed ledger technologies enable **Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)** that coordinate activities through transparent, programmable rules rather than hierarchical structures [@atzori2018-trust-chain].

### 2.2.1 Cross-cutting Technical and Institutional Trends {#sec-trends-cross}

1.  **Transparency and Traceability**: Regulators and investors demand verifiable reporting and auditable governance.\
2.  **Programmability and Automation**: Smart contracts allow rules to be enforced automatically, reducing administrative overhead.\
3.  **Stakeholder Inclusion**: Decentralised models encourage wider participation, improving legitimacy and resilience [@aghion1997-decentralization].\
4.  **Regulatory Alignment**: Adoption is shaped by EU disclosure requirements and ESG benchmarks.\
5.  **Institutional Experimentation**: Firms experiment with hybrid models combining traditional oversight with decentralised participation to balance compliance and innovation.

## 2.3 Benchmarking Traditional vs Decentralized Governance {#sec-benchmark}

Traditional governance relies on hierarchical oversight, while decentralised governance distributes authority across tokenised or participatory systems. Benchmarking reveals fundamental differences:

| Dimension | Traditional Governance | Decentralised Governance |
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Decision-making | Centralised, board-driven | Distributed, token- or member-driven |
| Transparency | Periodic reports | Continuous, on-chain data |
| Participation | Limited to executives/board | Open to wider stakeholder groups |
| Accountability | Opaque, delayed | Traceable, auditable in real time |
| Adaptability | Slow, reactive | Flexible, programmable |

: Benchmarking governance models {#tbl-benchmark}

### 2.3.1 Design Implications for VIRIDIS {#sec-implications}

-   VIRIDIS must shorten decision cycles to compete in fast-moving green tech markets.\
-   Transparent dashboards and voting mechanisms would directly align with EU disclosure rules.\
-   Tokenisation could serve a dual purpose of mobilising capital and granting governance rights.\
-   Inclusive governance strengthens trust and broadens the investor base.

### 2.3.2 Key Performance Indicators for Evaluation {#sec-kpis}

-   **Participation Rate**: % of stakeholders actively involved in decision-making.\
-   **Capital Inflow**: additional investment raised under decentralised governance.\
-   **Decision Cycle Time**: average time to move from proposal to decision.\
-   **Transparency Index**: proportion of governance events publicly auditable.\
-   **Trust Indicators**: survey-based metrics of investor and stakeholder confidence.

## 2.4 Risks and Opportunities in Transition {#sec-risks}

**Risks**\
- **Technical**: vulnerabilities in smart contracts or blockchain scalability [@tkachuk2023-efficient-design].\
- **Cultural**: resistance among employees or investors unfamiliar with decentralised processes.\
- **Regulatory**: unclear status of DAOs within EU financial regulation creates compliance uncertainty.

**Opportunities**\
- **Capital Mobilisation**: alignment with EU sustainable finance frameworks positions VIRIDIS as a credible investment destination [@kellers2022-mobilizing-capital].\
- **Innovation**: decentralised governance fosters rapid experimentation and idea generation.\
- **Competitive Differentiation**: by adopting DAO principles, VIRIDIS can establish itself as a frontrunner in sustainable finance and governance innovation.

# 3. Scope and Limitations {#sec-scope}

## 3.1 Scope of the Project {#sec-in}

The scope of this project is the **design, analysis, and validation** of a decentralised governance model for VIRIDIS. The project specifically focuses on how governance reform can support capital mobilisation and improve stakeholder participation within the company’s sustainable finance ecosystem.

The work includes:\
- A comprehensive analysis of the **current governance structure** of VIRIDIS.\
- A **stakeholder mapping and classification** to identify incentives and engagement mechanisms.\
- The application of ideation and design methods (SCAMPER, heatmaps, iteration rounds) to generate solution concepts.\
- The **design of a DAO-enabled operating model**, including token-based voting, transparent dashboards, and rule-setting mechanisms.\
- Testing through **prototyping, workshops, and feedback loops** with both direct and indirect stakeholders.\
- Development of a **multi-value business case** that covers financial, technological, and societal dimensions.\
- A **phased implementation roadmap** aligned with EU sustainable finance frameworks and VIRIDIS’s growth strategy.

## 3.2 Out of Scope {#sec-out}

Several areas fall outside the scope of this report to maintain focus and feasibility:

-   **Full-scale technical implementation**: while prototypes are developed, a production-ready blockchain infrastructure is outside the scope.\
-   **Policy design beyond EU frameworks**: global regulatory harmonisation is acknowledged but not addressed in detail.\
-   **Non-financial performance of portfolio startups**: the emphasis is on governance and capital mobilisation rather than sectoral technology outcomes.\
-   **Long-term macroeconomic forecasting**: while scenarios are explored, full predictive modelling of global markets is excluded.\
-   **Legal adjudication**: the report does not provide binding legal interpretations of DAO or token regulation.

## 3.3 Limitations {#sec-limits}

This study is subject to several limitations:

-   **Single-case design**: focusing on VIRIDIS limits generalisability to other firms, though findings may have broader relevance.\
-   **Time-bound research**: the report is based on a one-year project window, restricting longitudinal analysis of governance impacts.\
-   **Stakeholder sampling**: while both direct and indirect stakeholders were consulted, the number of participants was constrained by availability and project scope.\
-   **Prototype fidelity**: prototypes used in workshops are simplified representations and may not capture all technical complexities of DAO systems.\
-   **Regulatory uncertainty**: EU frameworks are evolving, meaning that assumptions made in this study could shift as new laws and guidelines are introduced.

Despite these limitations, the study provides a robust foundation for evaluating the viability of decentralised governance at VIRIDIS and for informing further development.

# 4. Problem Analysis and Research {#sec-analysis}

## 4.1 Current Governance Setup {#sec-current-gov}

VIRIDIS currently employs a **dual-entity governance structure**:\
- **V-GTI (VIRIDIS Green Tech Investment AG)** is the for-profit entity responsible for raising capital, managing investments, and steering strategic decision-making.\
- **V-ECO (VIRIDIS Eco-System gGmbH)** is the non-profit branch focused on incubation, education, and community engagement.

While this structure reflects the company’s hybrid mission of generating both economic and social value, it suffers from several inefficiencies: overlapping board membership, centralisation of authority, and lack of transparent communication with broader stakeholders. These issues have a direct impact on investor confidence, stakeholder trust, and overall scalability.

### 4.1.1 Structure and Oversight {#sec-oversight}

The oversight system is highly centralised, with decision-making concentrated in the boards of V-GTI and V-ECO. Key characteristics include:

-   **Board Overlap**: Many directors sit on both boards, reducing diversity of perspectives and concentrating power.\
-   **Hierarchical Decision Flow**: Strategic initiatives require approval from a small executive group, delaying responsiveness.\
-   **Accountability Gaps**: Oversight mechanisms are internally managed, limiting external visibility into governance outcomes.

This structural design ensures control but weakens inclusivity. For a firm competing in the sustainable finance domain, where transparency and participation are critical, the current model undermines alignment with investor and regulatory expectations.

### 4.1.2 Talent and Culture {#sec-culture}

The cultural environment within VIRIDIS is shaped by its early-stage entrepreneurial context. The team demonstrates strong **commitment to sustainability and innovation**, yet several challenges have been identified:

-   **Centralised Decision Culture**: Employees and mid-level managers have limited input into strategic choices, which reduces engagement and slows innovation.\
-   **Participation Barriers**: Community members and token investors lack clear mechanisms to contribute ideas or influence governance.\
-   **Trust Deficit**: Stakeholder interviews conducted during GP2 revealed concerns about transparency and inclusivity, particularly among external partners and investors.

A decentralised governance system could help shift this culture toward one of **shared ownership, accountability, and innovation**, thereby increasing both trust and productivity.

### 4.1.3 Infrastructure and Technology {#sec-it}

The current technological infrastructure of VIRIDIS supports core operations but lacks integrated systems for decentralised participation. Identified issues include:

-   **Fragmented IT Systems**: Governance and investment processes are supported by traditional digital tools but not by blockchain-enabled platforms.\
-   **Limited Transparency Tools**: Reporting is largely periodic and static, falling short of the real-time traceability expected by sustainable finance stakeholders.\
-   **No On-Chain Governance**: The VIA Security Token exists primarily as a financial instrument; its governance functionalities (e.g., voting rights) are not fully operationalised.

These limitations highlight the need for a **blockchain-based governance infrastructure** with features such as:\
- Token-weighted voting.\
- Smart contract–based rules and accountability.\
- Dashboards for real-time transparency and monitoring.

Together, these reforms can transform the VIRIDIS governance model into one that aligns with EU regulatory expectations and investor preferences for transparent, auditable systems.

## 4.2 Assessment of Gaps in Decision-Making and Inclusion {#sec-gaps}

The assessment of governance practices at VIRIDIS reveals a set of critical gaps in decision-making and inclusion. These gaps directly undermine the firm’s ability to mobilise capital, build trust, and align with sustainable finance expectations.

### 4.2.1 Hierarchical Limitations {#sec-hier}

The current governance structure is hierarchical and centralised, with most decision-making power concentrated at the executive and board levels. This creates several problems:

-   **Bureaucratic Bottlenecks**: Decisions require multiple layers of approval, leading to delays in fast-moving markets.\
-   **Concentration of Authority**: A small circle of board members holds disproportionate influence, reducing diversity of perspectives.\
-   **Low Stakeholder Agency**: Employees, token investors, and community members have limited or no role in shaping strategic initiatives.

These limitations restrict VIRIDIS’s responsiveness to emerging opportunities in the green-tech sector and diminish the inclusivity needed for stakeholder trust.

### 4.2.2 Transparency and Communication Gaps {#sec-comm}

A consistent theme from stakeholder feedback is the lack of transparency in governance processes. Identified gaps include:

-   **Opaque Decision Processes**: Stakeholders outside the board cannot trace how or why strategic decisions are made.\
-   **Irregular Communication**: Reporting is periodic and often delayed, limiting the availability of up-to-date information.\
-   **Perceived Exclusion**: Investors and community members perceive governance as a closed process, which discourages engagement and weakens credibility.

This gap contrasts sharply with EU sustainable finance regulations, which demand auditable and verifiable disclosures. Without improvement, VIRIDIS risks failing to meet both regulatory requirements and investor expectations.

### 4.2.3 Technology Adoption Challenges {#sec-tech-chal}

Although VIRIDIS has introduced the VIA Security Token, governance-related technology adoption remains incomplete. Key challenges include:

-   **Underutilised Token Functionality**: VIA is primarily used as a financial instrument; its governance potential (voting rights, proposal systems) has not been fully activated.\
-   **Lack of Integrated Dashboards**: No unified platform exists to display governance events, voting outcomes, or project progress in real time.\
-   **Limited Experimentation**: Prototypes for decentralised tools are still in early testing stages, preventing broader adoption and learning.

The absence of robust technological infrastructure prevents the company from operationalising decentralised governance and realising its benefits. As a result, investor trust, stakeholder participation, and regulatory alignment remain below potential.

**Summary**\
The combined effect of hierarchical limitations, transparency deficits, and incomplete technology adoption creates a governance gap that directly constrains investment mobilisation. Addressing these gaps through decentralised, DAO-enabled governance mechanisms is essential for VIRIDIS to achieve credibility, scalability, and alignment with EU sustainable finance frameworks.

# 5. Stakeholder Analysis, Mapping, and Engagement {#sec-engagement}

## 5.1 Identification of Key Stakeholders {#sec-ident}

The VIRIDIS ecosystem brings together a diverse set of stakeholders, both internal and external, who influence and are affected by governance outcomes. Based on interviews, document analysis, and workshop data, the following groups are identified:

-   **Internal Stakeholders**
    -   Board of Directors (V-GTI, V-ECO)\
    -   Employees and project managers\
    -   Token investors (VIA holders)
-   **External Stakeholders**
    -   Strategic partners (start-ups, incubated ventures, R&D institutions)\
    -   Government and regulatory bodies (EU financial authorities, sustainability regulators)\
    -   Community participants (local initiatives, civil society actors, sustainability advocates)\
    -   Private and institutional investors

## 5.2 Stakeholder Mapping (Direct and Indirect) {#sec-map}

Stakeholders are categorised as **direct** (actively involved in governance or operations) or **indirect** (influenced by governance decisions but not directly participating).

| Category | Stakeholder Group | Role in Governance |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Direct | Board of Directors (V-GTI, V-ECO) | Strategic oversight, approval |
| Direct | Employees and managers | Project execution |
| Direct | VIA token holders | Financial participation, voting |
| Direct | Strategic partners (start-ups, R&D) | Joint ventures, co-governance |
| Indirect | Government and regulators | Compliance, policy shaping |
| Indirect | Civil society and community groups | Legitimacy, social licence |
| Indirect | Institutional investors | Capital mobilisation |

: Direct and indirect stakeholder mapping {#tbl-stakeholders}

## 5.3 Engagement Levels and Classifications {#sec-engage-levels}

Each stakeholder group is assigned an engagement strategy, drawing on the IAP2 framework (inform, consult, involve, collaborate, empower):

-   **Inform**: Regulators and government bodies (transparent reporting, compliance updates).\
-   **Consult**: Institutional investors (feedback on governance, ESG alignment).\
-   **Involve**: Employees and project managers (participation in workshops, advisory roles).\
-   **Collaborate**: Strategic partners and start-ups (joint governance initiatives, co-design).\
-   **Empower**: Token holders and community participants (voting rights, proposal mechanisms).

This classification ensures that participation mechanisms are calibrated to the influence, interest, and salience of each stakeholder group.

## 5.4 Multi-Perspective Change Scenarios {#sec-scenarios}

To anticipate governance reforms, VIRIDIS explored multi-perspective change scenarios with stakeholders. Three key scenarios emerged:

1.  **Incremental Reform (Hybrid Model)**
    -   Retains hierarchical oversight but introduces consultative mechanisms for token holders and employees.\
    -   Low risk, but limited transformative impact on transparency and trust.
2.  **Participatory DAO (Phased Rollout)**
    -   Gradually expands decision-making rights to token holders and community members.\
    -   Uses pilots and prototypes to test dashboards, voting, and proposal systems.\
    -   Balances compliance with inclusivity.
3.  **Full DAO Transition**
    -   Transfers significant decision rights to a decentralised governance system.\
    -   Maximises transparency, accountability, and stakeholder inclusion.\
    -   Carries higher regulatory and cultural risks, but also greater potential for differentiation and innovation.

These scenarios reflect the range of possible pathways for VIRIDIS, from cautious adaptation to bold transformation. Stakeholder input consistently emphasised the importance of a **phased approach**, starting with hybrid models and scaling toward decentralised governance as trust and capability grow.

# 6. Solution Design and Development {#sec-solution}

## 6.2 Gap Analysis from GP3 Research {#sec-gap-res}

The findings from GP3 research highlight three central governance gaps at VIRIDIS:

-   **Decision-Making**: Overly centralised authority restricts agility and responsiveness.\
-   **Transparency**: Lack of real-time reporting and limited stakeholder visibility reduce trust.\
-   **Inclusion**: Investors, employees, and community members have insufficient voice in shaping strategy.

Workshops and interviews confirmed that these gaps translate into lower participation rates, weak investor confidence, and limited capital inflow. Addressing them requires an operating model that distributes authority, leverages technology for transparency, and expands participation beyond the board level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6.3 Ideation Process and Design Criteria {#sec-ideation}

The ideation process applied a structured design-thinking approach supported by the SCAMPER framework. Stakeholders were invited to co-create solutions through workshops and brainstorming sessions. Three design criteria guided the process:

1.  **Inclusivity**: Broaden participation by embedding mechanisms for token holders, employees, and partners.\
2.  **Transparency**: Provide real-time, verifiable reporting of decisions and outcomes.\
3.  **Feasibility**: Ensure proposed solutions are technically implementable and align with EU regulatory frameworks.

### 6.3.1 Iteration Round 1: Idea Generation {#sec-it1}

In the first ideation round, participants generated a broad set of potential solutions. Key ideas included:

-   **Token-weighted voting** using the VIA Security Token.\
-   **Transparent dashboards** displaying governance events and financial flows.\
-   **Delegated voting mechanisms** to increase efficiency while maintaining inclusivity.\
-   **Smart contract–based rules** for automatic execution of governance decisions.\
-   **Hybrid governance models** combining DAO participation with board oversight.

![](figs/BrainstormedIdeas.png){#fig-brainstorm fig-cap="Brainstormed ideas collected during initial ideation workshops (Geissler, 2025)."}

These ideas provided the foundation for subsequent evaluation and prioritisation.

### 6.3.2 Heatmap Analysis and Ratings {#sec-heatmap}

To evaluate the feasibility and impact of the brainstormed ideas, a heatmap analysis was conducted. Stakeholders rated each idea across three dimensions:

-   **Impact**: Potential to improve participation, trust, and capital mobilisation.\
-   **Feasibility**: Technical and organisational implementability in the short-to-medium term.\
-   **Alignment**: Fit with EU sustainable finance frameworks and VIRIDIS strategy.

| Idea                        | Impact | Feasibility | Alignment | Overall Score |
|-----------------------------|:------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:-------------:|
| Token-weighted voting       |  High  |   Medium    |   High    |      8.5      |
| Transparent dashboards      |  High  |    High     |   High    |      9.0      |
| Delegated voting            | Medium |   Medium    |  Medium   |      6.5      |
| Smart contract rules        |  High  |   Medium    |   High    |      8.0      |
| Hybrid DAO-board governance | Medium |    High     |   High    |      8.0      |

: Heatmap analysis of governance design ideas {#tbl-heatmap}

The results indicate that **transparent dashboards** and **token-weighted voting** emerged as the most impactful and feasible starting points. Smart contract rules and hybrid governance models were also prioritised for phased implementation, while delegated voting was considered less urgent.

### 6.3.3 Iteration Round 2 {#sec-it2}

In the second iteration, the shortlisted ideas from the heatmap were refined with stakeholder feedback. Prototypes of dashboards and mock-ups of voting flows were presented in workshops. Key developments included:

-   **Dashboard Prototype**: A visual interface showing proposals, voting outcomes, and financial flows in real time.\
-   **Voting Flow Simulation**: Token holders simulated casting votes on pilot decisions using mock tokens.\
-   **Risk Mitigation Discussions**: Stakeholders raised concerns about regulatory compliance, prompting the addition of oversight features.

Stakeholder ratings in this round confirmed the need for a phased rollout, beginning with dashboards and voting, followed by more advanced smart contract automation.

### 6.3.4 Iteration Round 3: Final Selection {#sec-it3}

The third iteration focused on consolidation. Participants compared refined solutions and voted on the final design package. The following elements were selected:

-   **Core Features**:
    -   Token-weighted voting (VIA Security Token).\
    -   Transparent dashboards for proposals and outcomes.\
    -   Governance rules embedded in smart contracts for accountability.
-   **Supporting Features**:
    -   Delegated voting as an optional efficiency tool.\
    -   Hybrid oversight to balance board authority with DAO participation.

![](figs/ScamperIdeationAppliedToViridis.png){#fig-scamper fig-cap="Application of the SCAMPER framework to VIRIDIS governance reform (Geissler, 2025)."}

These features formed the basis of the optimal innovation solution for VIRIDIS.

## 6.4 Optimal Innovation Solution {#sec-optimal}

The optimal solution is a **DAO-enabled governance model** that integrates decentralised participation with transparent oversight mechanisms. Its key characteristics include:

-   **Inclusive Participation**: All VIA token holders can vote on strategic proposals.\
-   **Transparency**: Real-time dashboards display proposals, voting outcomes, and financial allocations.\
-   **Programmability**: Smart contracts enforce governance rules automatically, reducing manipulation risk.\
-   **Hybrid Oversight**: The board retains a supervisory role, ensuring compliance with EU regulations.

This solution directly addresses VIRIDIS’s governance gaps by broadening stakeholder engagement, increasing transparency, and mobilising investment capital.

## 6.5 Governance Architecture Overview {#sec-arch}

The governance design is specified at **architecture level** (what must exist), not at **implementation level** (how it will be built). This keeps GP3 within scope while making GP4 executable.

**Core components**

- **Voting layer (VIA-based)**  
  Token-weighted ballots with quorum and majority thresholds. Categories: strategic portfolio choices, sustainability initiatives, and community programs. Advisory by default; categories and thresholds are codified in the rule set.

- **Rules & policy layer**  
  A canonical ruleset defines (i) proposal lifecycle, (ii) eligibility, (iii) conflict-of-interest handling, and (iv) escalation paths. Edge cases (ties, lapsed quorums, urgent votes) are pre-defined to avoid ambiguity.

- **Transparency layer (governance dashboard spec)**  
  Public-by-default views of proposals, live vote tallies, outcomes, and post-decision actions. An audit pane shows immutable decision logs mapped to EU ESG disclosure items (taxonomy objective, DNSH, minimum safeguards).

- **Oversight & safeguards**  
  A supervisory check ensures legal and compliance alignment prior to enactment. Any exception path is time-boxed and logged to preserve accountability.

- **Data model (minimal)**  
  `Proposal(id, category, sponsor, created_at, closes_at, esg_tags)`  
  `Ballot(id, proposal_id, voter_id, weight, cast_at)`  
  `Outcome(proposal_id, quorum, result, enacted_at, reference_link)`

**Design rationale**

This architecture addresses the GP3 gaps directly: it **broadens participation** (clear voting rights), **raises transparency** (real-time, auditable views), and **keeps legitimacy** (explicit safeguards). It is technology-agnostic at this stage, enabling multiple GP4 build options without altering the GP3 logic.

### 6.5.1 Technical Design (Voting, Token, Dashboard) {#sec-tech}

The technical implementation plan builds on three modules:

1.  **Voting Mechanism**: Token-weighted voting integrated into the VIA Security Token smart contract.\
2.  **Governance Dashboard**: Web-based interface showing proposals, votes, and outcomes.\
3.  **Smart Contracts**: Automated enforcement of governance rules, including quorum thresholds and veto options.

The system is designed for gradual rollout, starting with advisory votes before moving to binding governance decisions.

### 6.5.2 Governance Structure and Rules {#sec-structure}

The governance framework defines responsibilities and safeguards:

-   **Proposal Submission**: Token holders and board members can submit proposals.\
-   **Voting Rules**: Decisions require quorum and majority thresholds defined in smart contracts.\
-   **Delegated Voting**: Optional mechanism for efficiency, allowing token holders to delegate votes.\
-   **Oversight Layer**: The board retains veto power over proposals that conflict with legal or regulatory requirements.\
-   **Audit and Traceability**: All actions are logged on-chain for transparency and accountability.

This structure balances decentralisation with the compliance and stability required by EU regulators.

## 6.6 Implications for VIRIDIS {#sec-implications-viridis}

Adopting this DAO-enabled governance model has several implications:

-   **Strategic**: Positions VIRIDIS as a pioneer in sustainable finance governance, differentiating it in the European market.\
-   **Financial**: Enhanced transparency and inclusion increase investor confidence, mobilising additional capital flows.\
-   **Cultural**: Shifts organisational culture toward participation, accountability, and innovation.\
-   **Regulatory**: Aligns governance practices with EU disclosure frameworks while retaining oversight mechanisms to mitigate legal uncertainty.\
-   **Scalability**: Creates a governance infrastructure capable of growing with VIRIDIS’s ecosystem, supporting future expansion into global markets.

The transition to this model requires careful implementation but offers transformative potential in addressing both the governance and investment gaps at VIRIDIS.

# 7. Validation and Testing {#sec-validation}

## 7.1 Prototyping (Dashboard, Token Voting Flow) {#sec-prototype}

Prototypes were developed to test the functionality and usability of decentralised governance tools. Two main prototypes were created:

-   **Governance Dashboard**: A web interface displaying proposals, live voting outcomes, and project metrics.\
-   **Token Voting Flow**: A simulation of VIA Security Token–based voting, allowing participants to cast votes and see results reflected on the dashboard.

These prototypes demonstrated the feasibility of integrating blockchain-based decision-making with user-friendly interfaces.

## 7.2 Pilot Workshops and Feedback Loops {#sec-workshops}

Pilot workshops were conducted with selected employees, token holders, and partners. Participants interacted with the prototypes and provided feedback on:

-   **Usability**: Interface clarity, ease of navigation, and voting mechanics.\
-   **Trust**: Perceived transparency of decision-making processes.\
-   **Functionality**: Adequacy of reporting features and proposal tracking.

Feedback loops were integrated by iteratively refining the prototypes after each workshop session. This ensured progressive improvement and alignment with stakeholder expectations.

## 7.3 Validation with Direct Stakeholders {#sec-direct}

Direct stakeholders — including board members, employees, and token investors — were engaged to validate the prototypes against strategic goals. Key findings:

-   Board members valued the retention of oversight mechanisms and veto functions.\
-   Employees appreciated improved visibility into governance processes.\
-   Token investors expressed increased trust in transparent, auditable voting mechanisms.

## 7.4 Validation with Indirect Stakeholders and Non-Users {#sec-indirect}

Indirect stakeholders, such as regulators, institutional investors, and community representatives, were consulted to assess alignment with broader expectations:

-   Regulators emphasised the importance of compliance and integration with EU reporting frameworks.\
-   Institutional investors highlighted the added value of auditable decision-making for ESG compliance.\
-   Community representatives welcomed opportunities for meaningful participation in governance.

## 7.5 Positive and Negative Side Effects {#sec-effects}

**Positive effects**\
- Greater engagement and trust across diverse stakeholder groups.\
- More efficient decision-making cycles through transparent digital tools.\
- Strengthened alignment with EU sustainable finance frameworks.

**Negative effects**\
- Risk of decision fatigue among token holders due to frequent voting.\

: V-ECO revenue streams and estimates {#tbl-veco-revenue}

Together, V-GTI and V-ECO form a **dual revenue model**: V-GTI drives financial return on investment, while V-ECO generates social impact revenues. This combination strengthens VIRIDIS’s ability to deliver both economic and societal value within a decentralised governance framework. \## 8.3 Financial Model and Payback Period {#sec-payback}

The financial model integrates CAPEX, OPEX, cost savings, and projected revenues. The aim is to estimate the **payback period** of the DAO-enabled governance system.

-   **CAPEX** (one-time): €625,000 (§8.1.1).\
-   **OPEX** (annual): €210,000 (§8.1.2).\
-   **Annual Savings**: €300,000 (§8.1.3).\
-   **Revenue Growth**: driven by V-GTI and V-ECO (§8.2).

The model suggests that breakeven is achievable within **3–4 years**, depending on the growth rate of revenue streams and realisation of efficiency gains.

```{python}
# Example Python simulation for payback period
import numpy as np

capex = 625000
opex = 210000
savings = 300000
revenues = [150000, 400000, 900000, 1200000, 1400000]

cashflows = []
cumulative = -capex
for r in revenues:
    yearly = r + savings - opex
    cumulative += yearly
    cashflows.append(cumulative)

cashflows
```
