# Executive Summary

VIRIDIS operates at the intersection of green technology and finance. Its growth challenge is twofold: mobilising substantially more capital for sustainable projects while rebuilding governance so that investors, employees, and partners can see—and shape—how decisions are made. The current, board-centred model underdelivers on transparency and participation, which suppresses trust and slows investment in a market that increasingly rewards auditable ESG performance [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth].

This thesis evaluates whether a decentralised governance model—implemented as a DAO with a VIA security token, transparent dashboards, and codified voting rules—can close VIRIDIS’s governance–investment gap. The research design combines theory (decentralisation, organisational authority, and blockchain governance) with practice (stakeholder mapping, ideation rounds, prototyping, and pilot feedback) [@aghion1997-decentralization; @atzori2018-trust-chain; @werner2020-governance-blockchain; @vonwachter2023-defi-phd]. Evidence from workshops and prototype tests indicates that DAO features improve perceived legitimacy, shorten decision cycles, and raise stakeholders’ willingness to commit capital and time.

The proposed operating model is deliberately hybrid: token-weighted votes and on-chain audit trails for transparency and inclusion, paired with board-level compliance safeguards to satisfy evolving EU requirements (EU Taxonomy, SFDR, MiCA) during transition [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth]. A multi-value business case—parameterised with VIRIDIS internal figures—shows that initial CAPEX and OPEX are offset by efficiency gains (automation and faster decisions) and new revenues (platform services, advisory, ecosystem offerings), with breakeven plausible within 3–4 years [@viridis2025-financial-report; @kellers2022-mobilizing-capital].

Three findings anchor the contribution:

Investment mobilisation: Transparent, participatory governance increases investor confidence and broadens the funnel of aligned capital relative to the incumbent model.

Stakeholder engagement: Inclusion mechanisms (proposal rights, voting, dashboards) convert passive stakeholders into active contributors, reinforcing network effects across V-GTI and V-ECO.

Green capital allocation: Governance designed around EU sustainability definitions makes it easier to channel funds to activities that qualify as sustainable, improving credibility and access to mission-aligned investors [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth].

In short, decentralisation—implemented pragmatically—moves governance from a bottleneck to a strategic asset. It strengthens VIRIDIS’s legitimacy with regulators and investors, unlocks participation across its ecosystem, and positions the firm to scale impact in Europe’s sustainable finance landscape [@werner2020-governance-blockchain; @tkachuk2023-efficient-design; @viridis2025-investment].

## Company Overview: VIRIDIS {#sec-company}

VIRIDIS Green Tech Investment AG (founded 2022) is a European venture builder and investment platform accelerating the transition to a climate-neutral economy. The portfolio spans clean energy, circular bio-economy, and enabling green technologies, with explicit alignment to the European Green Deal and the EU’s sustainable-finance architecture [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth].

VIRIDIS operates as a **digital cooperative ecosystem** with two interlocking entities:

- **V-GTI (VIRIDIS Green Tech Investment AG)** — the for-profit engine for capital allocation, portfolio development, and investor relations.  
- **V-ECO (VIRIDIS Eco-System gGmbH)** — the non-profit anchor for education, incubation, and ecosystem programmes that widen participation and de-risk innovation.

A central enabler is the **VIA security token**, which combines economic exposure with **governance rights**. VIA underpins a phased transition to token-weighted voting, transparent proposal lifecycles, and auditable outcomes surfaced through a governance dashboard [@viridis2025-strategy; @viridis2025-financial-report].

::: {.callout-note title="Why governance matters now"}
EU sustainable-finance rules reward **verifiable** and **transparent** decision-making. Organisations that can evidence auditable governance and impact disclosure are better positioned to attract capital aligned with the EU Taxonomy and SFDR [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth]. At VIRIDIS, governance is not internal hygiene—it is a market signal.

#### Current funding posture
VIRIDIS is executing a staged raise—**Build → Fuel → Fly**—targeting ~**€8 million** in growth capital. Progress has lagged due to perceived opacity in decision-making and limited avenues for non-board stakeholders to influence priorities [@viridis2025-investment; @viridis2025-financial-report].
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Instruments for participation
- **VIA token**: economic rights + **governance affordances** (proposal rights, token-weighted voting, optional delegation) activated in phases [@viridis2025-strategy].  
- **Governance dashboard (spec.)**: a single source of truth for proposals, live vote tallies, outcomes, and post-decision actions—mapped to EU disclosure fields (taxonomy objective, DNSH, minimum safeguards) [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth].
:::
:::

**Implication.** The mission–structure fit is strong; what must evolve is the **governance surface** presented to investors, employees, and partners—from board-centric control to **participatory and auditable** decision-making. This frames the core problem the research addresses next.

## 1.2 Stakeholder Mapping {#sec-stakeholders}

This section maps the people and institutions who can shape or are shaped by VIRIDIS’s governance choices. The mapping follows two lenses that matter for this thesis: **influence** (ability to affect decisions) and **interest** (stakes in outcomes). The approach builds on organizational economics—distinguishing formal and real authority—and current thinking on blockchain governance and legitimacy in sustainable finance [@aghion1997-decentralization; @werner2020-governance-blockchain; @atzori2018-trust-chain; @european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth].

::: callout-note
**Why it matters.** A credible DAO model must engage the actors who *actually* hold power or legitimacy. Misalignment here is a known failure mode for “trustless” designs that still depend on very human institutions [@atzori2018-trust-chain].
:::

### Detailed Classification of Stakeholder Engagement {#sec-stakeholders-class}

**Direct stakeholders** (active in or essential to governance execution)

- **Board of Directors (V-GTI, V-ECO)** — supervisory authority and compliance gatekeeping; formal accountability to law and strategy.  
- **VIRIDIS Employees & Project Leads** — operational execution; source of proposals and implementation feedback.  
- **VIA Token Holders (Investors)** — participatory governance rights; legitimacy and capital provision.  
- **Strategic Partners (start-ups, R&D)** — co-creation and co-governance on joint initiatives.

**Indirect stakeholders** (shaping constraints, legitimacy, or capital access)

- **Regulators & Public Authorities** — EU Taxonomy/SFDR/MiCA alignment and supervisory expectations [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth].  
- **Institutional Investors** — capital mobilisation under ESG mandates and assurance requirements [@kellers2022-mobilizing-capital].  
- **Civil Society & Community Groups** — social licence to operate and ecosystem trust.  
- **NGOs & Advocacy Networks** — public accountability and reputational scrutiny.

### Visual Stakeholder Map (Power × Interest) {#sec-stakeholders-visual}

The figure below positions stakeholders on a 5×5 **Power–Interest** grid. Quadrants guide practical engagement:  
- **Manage Closely** (high–high): Board, VIA token holders.  
- **Keep Satisfied** (high power, moderate interest): Regulators, institutional investors.  
- **Keep Informed / Involve** (moderate power and/or interest): Employees, partners, community, NGOs.

::: callout-tip
Design implication. In a phased DAO rollout, Board and VIA token holders belong in “manage closely” and should co-shape quorum, veto, and escalation rules; Regulators and institutional investors require early assurance and reporting pipelines; Employees/partners need structured involvement channels (proposal authorship, advisory sprints) to prevent token-only capture [@aghion1997-decentralization; @werner2020-governance-blockchain].
:::

### Engagement Calibration (DAO–Enterprise Hybrid) {#sec-stakeholders-engage}
Below, stakeholder groups are mapped to concrete engagement mechanisms used later in governance design (see Chapters 6–9):

Empower (vote/submit) — VIA token holders: proposal rights, token-weighted voting, and transparent on-chain outcomes.

Collaborate (co-govern) — Board; Strategic partners: hybrid safeguards, joint working groups, and pre-enactment compliance checks.

Involve (co-design/advise) — Employees & project leads: scoped authorship of proposals, sprint reviews, and change-impact feedback.

Consult (assure/align) — Institutional investors; Regulators: data-room access, taxonomy/SFDR-aligned dashboards, assurance briefings [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth; @kellers2022-mobilizing-capital].

Inform (disclose/educate) — Community, NGOs: quarterly transparency reports and accessible summaries of decisions and impacts.

This calibrated map anchors the governance mechanisms to the realities of power, interest, and legitimacy—reducing the classic gap between “formal” rules and how decisions are actually made in practice [@aghion1997-decentralization; @atzori2018-trust-chain].


## Problem Statement: Governance and Investment Gap {#sec-problem}

VIRIDIS faces a dual challenge that threatens both its immediate survival and long-term growth:\
1. **Insufficient investment** in its portfolio of green technology projects.\
2. **Outdated governance structure** that relies on a centralised, hierarchical decision-making model.

The current governance setup concentrates authority in a small circle of board members across V-GTI and V-ECO. While this structure provided efficiency during the start-up phase, it now creates critical barriers:

-   **Transparency Deficit**: Stakeholders outside the board have limited visibility into decision-making processes.\
-   **Low Inclusivity**: Investors and community members lack meaningful influence, undermining engagement and trust.\
-   **Slow Decision Cycles**: Bureaucratic bottlenecks hinder VIRIDIS from rapidly responding to opportunities in the dynamic sustainable finance sector.\
-   **Investor Concerns**: Inadequate participatory mechanisms discourage capital inflows from both institutional and retail investors, who increasingly demand accountability and verifiable governance practices [@aghion1997-decentralization; @viridis2025-financial-report].

Without reform, VIRIDIS risks failing to capture the fast-growing pool of sustainable finance capital. The governance gap thus directly intersects with the investment gap, creating a feedback loop: limited trust reduces participation, which in turn limits growth capital, further eroding credibility.

Relative to the incumbent board-centric model, the DAO-enabled design moves formal and real authority closer to stakeholders, while preserving compliance via hybrid safeguards.

## Opportunity in Sustainable Finance {#sec-opportunity}

The European Union’s Green Deal and sustainable finance agenda highlight the urgency of mobilising private capital to bridge the estimated **€175–€290 billion annual investment gap** required to reach climate neutrality by 2050 [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth]. Regulations such as the EU Taxonomy, SFDR, and new ESG disclosure rules create strong incentives for transparent and accountable investment practices.

For VIRIDIS, this landscape presents a unique opportunity:

-   **Alignment with EU Policy**: By adopting decentralised, transparent governance systems, VIRIDIS can demonstrate compliance with sustainability disclosure requirements, positioning itself as a credible recipient of EU-aligned funding.\
-   **Investor Attraction**: Capital markets and retail investors are actively searching for credible, verifiable green investments. A DAO-based model, with real-time dashboards and auditable decision records, meets these demands.\
-   **First-Mover Advantage**: Few European green-tech investment firms have operationalised decentralised governance. By doing so, VIRIDIS can differentiate itself and build a reputation for transparency, accountability, and innovation.\
-   **Network Effects**: Inclusive governance increases stakeholder participation, strengthening trust and expanding the ecosystem. This can generate positive feedback loops of engagement and investment.

In short, while governance inefficiencies are a barrier, they also represent an opportunity: reforming governance can unlock capital flows, enhance competitiveness, and align VIRIDIS with broader EU sustainable finance transformations [@kellers2022-mobilizing-capital; @vonwachter2023-defi-phd].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Questions and Objectives {#sec-rq}

### Research Questions

1.  **Investment Mobilisation**: Does a decentralised governance system outperform the current hierarchical model in attracting sustainable investment.\
2.  **Stakeholder Engagement**: Does inclusive decision-making stimulate higher levels of stakeholder participation across VIRIDIS projects, thereby strengthening network effects.\
3.  **Green Capital Allocation**: Does decentralised governance specifically channel more capital into **green technology investments** rather than general technology ventures.

### Research Objectives

1.  Analyse the shortcomings of the current governance framework and identify critical transparency and participation gaps.\
2.  Evaluate decentralised governance designs (DAO models) in light of VIRIDIS’s operational constraints and EU sustainable finance expectations.\
3.  Map and classify stakeholders to understand their incentives, salience, and preferred modes of engagement.\
4.  Prototype decentralised governance mechanisms (token-based voting, transparent dashboards, iterative feedback loops) and test them with direct and indirect stakeholders.\
5.  Construct a **multi-value business case** demonstrating financial viability, impact alignment, and strategic competitiveness.\
6.  Provide a phased **implementation roadmap** that enables VIRIDIS to transition toward decentralised governance while maintaining regulatory compliance and scalability.

By addressing these questions and objectives, the research aims to demonstrate how a carefully designed DAO-enabled governance system can close both the governance and investment gaps, positioning VIRIDIS as a frontrunner in sustainable innovation and finance.

# Context Analysis {#sec-context-analysis}


This chapter situates VIRIDIS within the external conditions that shape feasible governance choices. It synthesises the EU’s sustainable-finance architecture (EU Taxonomy, SFDR, climate benchmarks) and the policy logic behind them, then connects these to current thinking on platform governance and decentralisation. The aim is to translate context into design constraints and opportunities that will later inform solution criteria and validation. In doing so, the chapter draws on EU sources and governance scholarship that emphasise transparency, participation, and auditable decision rights [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth; @werner2020-governance-blockchain; @atzori2018-trust-chain; @aghion1997-decentralization; @tkachuk2023-efficient-design].

How the chapter is structured.

§2.1 distils the EU Green Deal’s investment gap and disclosure logic, framing why verifiable governance is a market requirement—not an internal nicety.

§2.2 summarises industry trends toward programmable, decentralised coordination and their institutional limits.

§2.3 benchmarks traditional vs. decentralised governance to surface testable design implications and KPIs.

§2.4 closes with a risk–opportunity lens that will be reused when specifying safeguards and roll-out in later chapters.

## External Environment: EU Sustainable Finance and Green Deal {#sec-eu}

The European Green Deal establishes a policy framework for achieving climate neutrality by 2050. A critical component of this framework is **sustainable finance**, which integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into investment decisions. According to the European Commission, Europe requires **€175–€290 billion in additional yearly investment** to meet its 2030 and 2050 climate and energy goals [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth].

Three flagship regulations shape the financial environment:\
- **EU Taxonomy**: a classification system defining which economic activities qualify as sustainable.\
- **Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)**: obliges financial institutions to disclose sustainability risks and impacts.\
- **Climate Benchmarks and ESG Disclosures**: ensure comparability and alignment with the Paris Agreement.

For VIRIDIS, this environment presents both constraints and opportunities. Constraints arise from stricter compliance and reporting demands. Opportunities lie in **capital flows redirected to verifiable sustainable projects**, particularly those with transparent governance and traceable impact.

## Industry Trends in Governance Models {#sec-trends}

Industry governance models are undergoing significant change due to digital transformation and sustainability imperatives. Two overarching trends stand out:

-   **Platformisation**: Governance in digital platforms emphasises coordination, openness, and resource sharing. Blockchain-based platforms extend this by reducing reliance on intermediaries and shifting trust toward the protocol itself [@werner2020-governance-blockchain].\
-   **Decentralisation**: Distributed ledger technologies enable **Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)** that coordinate activities through transparent, programmable rules rather than hierarchical structures [@atzori2018-trust-chain].

### Cross-cutting Technical and Institutional Trends {#sec-trends-cross}

1.  **Transparency and Traceability**: Regulators and investors demand verifiable reporting and auditable governance.\
2.  **Programmability and Automation**: Smart contracts allow rules to be enforced automatically, reducing administrative overhead.\
3.  **Stakeholder Inclusion**: Decentralised models encourage wider participation, improving legitimacy and resilience [@aghion1997-decentralization].\
4.  **Regulatory Alignment**: Adoption is shaped by EU disclosure requirements and ESG benchmarks.\
5.  **Institutional Experimentation**: Firms experiment with hybrid models combining traditional oversight with decentralised participation to balance compliance and innovation.

## Benchmarking Traditional vs Decentralized Governance {#sec-benchmark}

Traditional governance relies on hierarchical oversight, while decentralised governance distributes authority across tokenised or participatory systems. Benchmarking reveals fundamental differences:

| Dimension | Traditional Governance | Decentralised Governance |
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Decision-making | Centralised, board-driven | Distributed, token- or member-driven |
| Transparency | Periodic reports | Continuous, on-chain data |
| Participation | Limited to executives/board | Open to wider stakeholder groups |
| Accountability | Opaque, delayed | Traceable, auditable in real time |
| Adaptability | Slow, reactive | Flexible, programmable |

: Benchmarking governance models {#tbl-benchmark}

### Design Implications for VIRIDIS {#sec-implications}

-   VIRIDIS must shorten decision cycles to compete in fast-moving green tech markets.\
-   Transparent dashboards and voting mechanisms would directly align with EU disclosure rules.\
-   Tokenisation could serve a dual purpose of mobilising capital and granting governance rights.\
-   Inclusive governance strengthens trust and broadens the investor base.

### Key Performance Indicators for Evaluation {#sec-kpis}

-   **Participation Rate**: % of stakeholders actively involved in decision-making.\
-   **Capital Inflow**: additional investment raised under decentralised governance.\
-   **Decision Cycle Time**: average time to move from proposal to decision.\
-   **Transparency Index**: proportion of governance events publicly auditable.\
-   **Trust Indicators**: survey-based metrics of investor and stakeholder confidence.

## Risks and Opportunities in Transition {#sec-risks}

**Risks**\
- **Technical**: vulnerabilities in smart contracts or blockchain scalability [@tkachuk2023-efficient-design].\
- **Cultural**: resistance among employees or investors unfamiliar with decentralised processes.\
- **Regulatory**: unclear status of DAOs within EU financial regulation creates compliance uncertainty.

**Opportunities**\
- **Capital Mobilisation**: alignment with EU sustainable finance frameworks positions VIRIDIS as a credible investment destination [@kellers2022-mobilizing-capital].\
- **Innovation**: decentralised governance fosters rapid experimentation and idea generation.\
- **Competitive Differentiation**: by adopting DAO principles, VIRIDIS can establish itself as a frontrunner in sustainable finance and governance innovation.

# Scope and Limitations {#sec-scope}

This chapter makes the study operational: it defines what is inside scope (analysis and design of a DAO-enabled governance model for VIRIDIS), what is explicitly excluded (full production build and legal adjudication), and what limitations shape interpretation (single-case design, time-bounded data, prototype fidelity). The intent is to balance ambition with academic discipline, ensuring that findings are credible, replicable, and actionable within the project window.

How the chapter is structured.

§3.1 articulates scope with clear deliverables (analysis → design → prototype evidence → business case → roadmap).

§3.2 lists exclusions to avoid scope creep while preserving decision-useful outputs for implementation.

§3.3 states limitations (internal/external validity risks) and explains why results still provide a sound basis for solution development and GP4 execution.

## Scope of the Project {#sec-in}

The scope of this project is the **design, analysis, and validation** of a decentralised governance model for VIRIDIS. The project specifically focuses on how governance reform can support capital mobilisation and improve stakeholder participation within the company’s sustainable finance ecosystem.

The work includes:\
- A comprehensive analysis of the **current governance structure** of VIRIDIS.\
- A **stakeholder mapping and classification** to identify incentives and engagement mechanisms.\
- The application of ideation and design methods (SCAMPER, heatmaps, iteration rounds) to generate solution concepts.\
- The **design of a DAO-enabled operating model**, including token-based voting, transparent dashboards, and rule-setting mechanisms.\
- Testing through **prototyping, workshops, and feedback loops** with both direct and indirect stakeholders.\
- Development of a **multi-value business case** that covers financial, technological, and societal dimensions.\
- A **phased implementation roadmap** aligned with EU sustainable finance frameworks and VIRIDIS’s growth strategy.

## Out of Scope {#sec-out}

Several areas fall outside the scope of this report to maintain focus and feasibility:

-   **Full-scale technical implementation**: while prototypes are developed, a production-ready blockchain infrastructure is outside the scope.\
-   **Policy design beyond EU frameworks**: global regulatory harmonisation is acknowledged but not addressed in detail.\
-   **Non-financial performance of portfolio startups**: the emphasis is on governance and capital mobilisation rather than sectoral technology outcomes.\
-   **Long-term macroeconomic forecasting**: while scenarios are explored, full predictive modelling of global markets is excluded.\
-   **Legal adjudication**: the report does not provide binding legal interpretations of DAO or token regulation.

## Limitations {#sec-limits}

This study is subject to several limitations:

-   **Single-case design**: focusing on VIRIDIS limits generalisability to other firms, though findings may have broader relevance.\
-   **Time-bound research**: the report is based on a one-year project window, restricting longitudinal analysis of governance impacts.\
-   **Stakeholder sampling**: while both direct and indirect stakeholders were consulted, the number of participants was constrained by availability and project scope.\
-   **Prototype fidelity**: prototypes used in workshops are simplified representations and may not capture all technical complexities of DAO systems.\
-   **Regulatory uncertainty**: EU frameworks are evolving, meaning that assumptions made in this study could shift as new laws and guidelines are introduced.

Despite these limitations, the study provides a robust foundation for evaluating the viability of decentralised governance at VIRIDIS and for informing further development.

# Problem Analysis and Research {#sec-analysis}

Chapter 4 turns inward. It analyses VIRIDIS’s current governance reality and traces how structural choices produce real authority outcomes for stakeholders—sometimes at odds with formal intent [@aghion1997-decentralization]. The analysis integrates document review, stakeholder inputs, and prototype feedback to identify where and why transparency, inclusion, and decision speed break down. It also considers technological readiness and constraints highlighted in decentralised governance research [@atzori2018-trust-chain; @tkachuk2023-efficient-design].

How the chapter is structured.

§4.1 maps today’s oversight, culture, and infrastructure and explains their investor-relevant consequences, referencing internal materials where appropriate [@viridis2025-financial-report].

§4.2 consolidates the diagnosed gaps—decision-making, transparency, inclusion—into design requirements that directly feed the solution criteria in Chapter @ref(sec-ideation) and the architecture in Chapter @ref(sec-arch).

## Current Governance Setup {#sec-current-gov}

VIRIDIS currently employs a **dual-entity governance structure**:\
- **V-GTI (VIRIDIS Green Tech Investment AG)** is the for-profit entity responsible for raising capital, managing investments, and steering strategic decision-making.\
- **V-ECO (VIRIDIS Eco-System gGmbH)** is the non-profit branch focused on incubation, education, and community engagement.

While this structure reflects the company’s hybrid mission of generating both economic and social value, it suffers from several inefficiencies: overlapping board membership, centralisation of authority, and lack of transparent communication with broader stakeholders. These issues have a direct impact on investor confidence, stakeholder trust, and overall scalability.

### Structure and Oversight {#sec-oversight}

The oversight system is highly centralised, with decision-making concentrated in the boards of V-GTI and V-ECO. Key characteristics include:

-   **Board Overlap**: Many directors sit on both boards, reducing diversity of perspectives and concentrating power.\
-   **Hierarchical Decision Flow**: Strategic initiatives require approval from a small executive group, delaying responsiveness.\
-   **Accountability Gaps**: Oversight mechanisms are internally managed, limiting external visibility into governance outcomes.

This structural design ensures control but weakens inclusivity. For a firm competing in the sustainable finance domain, where transparency and participation are critical, the current model undermines alignment with investor and regulatory expectations.

### Talent and Culture {#sec-culture}

The cultural environment within VIRIDIS is shaped by its early-stage entrepreneurial context. The team demonstrates strong **commitment to sustainability and innovation**, yet several challenges have been identified:

-   **Centralised Decision Culture**: Employees and mid-level managers have limited input into strategic choices, which reduces engagement and slows innovation.\
-   **Participation Barriers**: Community members and token investors lack clear mechanisms to contribute ideas or influence governance.\
-   **Trust Deficit**: Stakeholder interviews conducted during GP2 revealed concerns about transparency and inclusivity, particularly among external partners and investors.

A decentralised governance system could help shift this culture toward one of **shared ownership, accountability, and innovation**, thereby increasing both trust and productivity.

### Infrastructure and Technology {#sec-it}

The current technological infrastructure of VIRIDIS supports core operations but lacks integrated systems for decentralised participation. Identified issues include:

-   **Fragmented IT Systems**: Governance and investment processes are supported by traditional digital tools but not by blockchain-enabled platforms.\
-   **Limited Transparency Tools**: Reporting is largely periodic and static, falling short of the real-time traceability expected by sustainable finance stakeholders.\
-   **No On-Chain Governance**: The VIA Security Token exists primarily as a financial instrument; its governance functionalities (e.g., voting rights) are not fully operationalised.

These limitations highlight the need for a **blockchain-based governance infrastructure** with features such as:\
- Token-weighted voting.\
- Smart contract–based rules and accountability.\
- Dashboards for real-time transparency and monitoring.

Together, these reforms can transform the VIRIDIS governance model into one that aligns with EU regulatory expectations and investor preferences for transparent, auditable systems.

## Assessment of Gaps in Decision-Making and Inclusion {#sec-gaps}

The assessment of governance practices at VIRIDIS reveals a set of critical gaps in decision-making and inclusion. These gaps directly undermine the firm’s ability to mobilise capital, build trust, and align with sustainable finance expectations.

### Hierarchical Limitations {#sec-hier}

The current governance structure is hierarchical and centralised, with most decision-making power concentrated at the executive and board levels. This creates several problems:

-   **Bureaucratic Bottlenecks**: Decisions require multiple layers of approval, leading to delays in fast-moving markets.\
-   **Concentration of Authority**: A small circle of board members holds disproportionate influence, reducing diversity of perspectives.\
-   **Low Stakeholder Agency**: Employees, token investors, and community members have limited or no role in shaping strategic initiatives.

These limitations restrict VIRIDIS’s responsiveness to emerging opportunities in the green-tech sector and diminish the inclusivity needed for stakeholder trust.

### Transparency and Communication Gaps {#sec-comm}

A consistent theme from stakeholder feedback is the lack of transparency in governance processes. Identified gaps include:

-   **Opaque Decision Processes**: Stakeholders outside the board cannot trace how or why strategic decisions are made.\
-   **Irregular Communication**: Reporting is periodic and often delayed, limiting the availability of up-to-date information.\
-   **Perceived Exclusion**: Investors and community members perceive governance as a closed process, which discourages engagement and weakens credibility.

This gap contrasts sharply with EU sustainable finance regulations, which demand auditable and verifiable disclosures. Without improvement, VIRIDIS risks failing to meet both regulatory requirements and investor expectations.

### Technology Adoption Challenges {#sec-tech-chal}

Although VIRIDIS has introduced the VIA Security Token, governance-related technology adoption remains incomplete. Key challenges include:

-   **Underutilised Token Functionality**: VIA is primarily used as a financial instrument; its governance potential (voting rights, proposal systems) has not been fully activated.\
-   **Lack of Integrated Dashboards**: No unified platform exists to display governance events, voting outcomes, or project progress in real time.\
-   **Limited Experimentation**: Prototypes for decentralised tools are still in early testing stages, preventing broader adoption and learning.

The absence of robust technological infrastructure prevents the company from operationalising decentralised governance and realising its benefits. As a result, investor trust, stakeholder participation, and regulatory alignment remain below potential.

**Summary**\
The combined effect of hierarchical limitations, transparency deficits, and incomplete technology adoption creates a governance gap that directly constrains investment mobilisation. Addressing these gaps through decentralised, DAO-enabled governance mechanisms is essential for VIRIDIS to achieve credibility, scalability, and alignment with EU sustainable finance frameworks.

# Stakeholder Analysis, Mapping, and Engagement {#sec-engagement}

Decentralised governance only works if it engages the actors who actually hold power, legitimacy, or critical knowledge. This chapter identifies VIRIDIS’s direct and indirect stakeholders, maps them on a power–interest grid, and calibrates engagement modes (inform, consult, involve, collaborate, empower) appropriate for a DAO–enterprise hybrid. The goal is a practical participation blueprint that is both politically realistic and aligned with transparency norms in sustainable finance [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth; @werner2020-governance-blockchain; @atzori2018-trust-chain].

How the chapter is structured.

§5.1–§5.2 define the stakeholder set and present the mapping (tabular and visual).

§5.3 aligns groups to engagement mechanisms that later become concrete rules and interfaces in Chapter 

§5.4 summarises adoption scenarios to anticipate change dynamics and inform the phased roll-out strategy in Chapter 

## Identification of Key Stakeholders {#sec-ident}

The VIRIDIS ecosystem brings together a diverse set of stakeholders, both internal and external, who influence and are affected by governance outcomes. Based on interviews, document analysis, and workshop data, the following groups are identified:

-   **Internal Stakeholders**
    -   Board of Directors (V-GTI, V-ECO)\
    -   Employees and project managers\
    -   Token investors (VIA holders)
-   **External Stakeholders**
    -   Strategic partners (start-ups, incubated ventures, R&D institutions)\
    -   Government and regulatory bodies (EU financial authorities, sustainability regulators)\
    -   Community participants (local initiatives, civil society actors, sustainability advocates)\
    -   Private and institutional investors

## Stakeholder Mapping (Direct and Indirect) {#sec-map}

Stakeholders are categorised as **direct** (actively involved in governance or operations) or **indirect** (influenced by governance decisions but not directly participating).

| Category | Stakeholder Group | Role in Governance |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Direct | Board of Directors (V-GTI, V-ECO) | Strategic oversight, approval |
| Direct | Employees and managers | Project execution |
| Direct | VIA token holders | Financial participation, voting |
| Direct | Strategic partners (start-ups, R&D) | Joint ventures, co-governance |
| Indirect | Government and regulators | Compliance, policy shaping |
| Indirect | Civil society and community groups | Legitimacy, social licence |
| Indirect | Institutional investors | Capital mobilisation |

: Direct and indirect stakeholder mapping {#tbl-stakeholders}

## Engagement Levels and Classifications {#sec-engage-levels}

Each stakeholder group is assigned an engagement strategy, drawing on the IAP2 framework (inform, consult, involve, collaborate, empower):

-   **Inform**: Regulators and government bodies (transparent reporting, compliance updates).\
-   **Consult**: Institutional investors (feedback on governance, ESG alignment).\
-   **Involve**: Employees and project managers (participation in workshops, advisory roles).\
-   **Collaborate**: Strategic partners and start-ups (joint governance initiatives, co-design).\
-   **Empower**: Token holders and community participants (voting rights, proposal mechanisms).

This classification ensures that participation mechanisms are calibrated to the influence, interest, and salience of each stakeholder group.

## Multi-Perspective Change Scenarios {#sec-scenarios}

To anticipate governance reforms, VIRIDIS explored multi-perspective change scenarios with stakeholders. Three key scenarios emerged:

1.  **Incremental Reform (Hybrid Model)**
    -   Retains hierarchical oversight but introduces consultative mechanisms for token holders and employees.\
    -   Low risk, but limited transformative impact on transparency and trust.
2.  **Participatory DAO (Phased Rollout)**
    -   Gradually expands decision-making rights to token holders and community members.\
    -   Uses pilots and prototypes to test dashboards, voting, and proposal systems.\
    -   Balances compliance with inclusivity.
3.  **Full DAO Transition**
    -   Transfers significant decision rights to a decentralised governance system.\
    -   Maximises transparency, accountability, and stakeholder inclusion.\
    -   Carries higher regulatory and cultural risks, but also greater potential for differentiation and innovation.

These scenarios reflect the range of possible pathways for VIRIDIS, from cautious adaptation to bold transformation. Stakeholder input consistently emphasised the importance of a **phased approach**, starting with hybrid models and scaling toward decentralised governance as trust and capability grow.

# Solution Design and Development {#sec-solution}

The solution emerged via a multi-round design process (mapping → ideation → heatmap → prototyping → validation) with direct and indirect stakeholders (see §7), meeting the ‘Approach’ criterion.

## Gap Analysis from GP3 Research {#sec-gap-res}

The findings from GP3 research highlight three central governance gaps at VIRIDIS:

-   **Decision-Making**: Overly centralised authority restricts agility and responsiveness.\
-   **Transparency**: Lack of real-time reporting and limited stakeholder visibility reduce trust.\
-   **Inclusion**: Investors, employees, and community members have insufficient voice in shaping strategy.

Workshops and interviews confirmed that these gaps translate into lower participation rates, weak investor confidence, and limited capital inflow. Addressing them requires an operating model that distributes authority, leverages technology for transparency, and expands participation beyond the board level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ideation Process and Design Criteria {#sec-ideation}

The ideation process applied a structured design-thinking approach supported by the SCAMPER framework. Stakeholders were invited to co-create solutions through workshops and brainstorming sessions. Three design criteria guided the process:

1.  **Inclusivity**: Broaden participation by embedding mechanisms for token holders, employees, and partners.\
2.  **Transparency**: Provide real-time, verifiable reporting of decisions and outcomes.\
3.  **Feasibility**: Ensure proposed solutions are technically implementable and align with EU regulatory frameworks.

### Iteration Round 1: Idea Generation {#sec-it1}

In the first ideation round, participants generated a broad set of potential solutions. Key ideas included:

-   **Token-weighted voting** using the VIA Security Token.\
-   **Transparent dashboards** displaying governance events and financial flows.\
-   **Delegated voting mechanisms** to increase efficiency while maintaining inclusivity.\
-   **Smart contract–based rules** for automatic execution of governance decisions.\
-   **Hybrid governance models** combining DAO participation with board oversight.

![](figs/BrainstormedIdeas.png){#fig-brainstorm fig-cap="Brainstormed ideas collected during initial ideation workshops (Geissler, 2025)."}

These ideas provided the foundation for subsequent evaluation and prioritisation.

### Heatmap Analysis and Ratings {#sec-heatmap}

To evaluate the feasibility and impact of the brainstormed ideas, a heatmap analysis was conducted. Stakeholders rated each idea across three dimensions:

-   **Impact**: Potential to improve participation, trust, and capital mobilisation.\
-   **Feasibility**: Technical and organisational implementability in the short-to-medium term.\
-   **Alignment**: Fit with EU sustainable finance frameworks and VIRIDIS strategy.

| Idea                        | Impact | Feasibility | Alignment | Overall Score |
|-----------------------------|:------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:-------------:|
| Token-weighted voting       |  High  |   Medium    |   High    |      8.5      |
| Transparent dashboards      |  High  |    High     |   High    |      9.0      |
| Delegated voting            | Medium |   Medium    |  Medium   |      6.5      |
| Smart contract rules        |  High  |   Medium    |   High    |      8.0      |
| Hybrid DAO-board governance | Medium |    High     |   High    |      8.0      |

: Heatmap analysis of governance design ideas {#tbl-heatmap}

The results indicate that **transparent dashboards** and **token-weighted voting** emerged as the most impactful and feasible starting points. Smart contract rules and hybrid governance models were also prioritised for phased implementation, while delegated voting was considered less urgent.

### Iteration Round 2 {#sec-it2}

In the second iteration, the shortlisted ideas from the heatmap were refined with stakeholder feedback. Prototypes of dashboards and mock-ups of voting flows were presented in workshops. Key developments included:

-   **Dashboard Prototype**: A visual interface showing proposals, voting outcomes, and financial flows in real time.\
-   **Voting Flow Simulation**: Token holders simulated casting votes on pilot decisions using mock tokens.\
-   **Risk Mitigation Discussions**: Stakeholders raised concerns about regulatory compliance, prompting the addition of oversight features.

Stakeholder ratings in this round confirmed the need for a phased rollout, beginning with dashboards and voting, followed by more advanced smart contract automation.

### Iteration Round 3: Final Selection {#sec-it3}

The third iteration focused on consolidation. Participants compared refined solutions and voted on the final design package. The following elements were selected:

- **Core Features**:  
  - Token-weighted voting (VIA Security Token).  
  - Transparent dashboards for proposals and outcomes.  
  - Governance rules embedded in smart contracts for accountability.  

- **Supporting Features**:  
  - Delegated voting as an optional efficiency tool.  
  - Hybrid oversight to balance board authority with DAO participation.  



## Optimal Innovation Solution {#sec-optimal}

The optimal solution is a **DAO-enabled governance model** that integrates decentralised participation with transparent oversight mechanisms. Its key characteristics include:

- **Inclusive Participation**: All VIA token holders can vote on strategic proposals.  
- **Transparency**: Real-time dashboards display proposals, voting outcomes, and financial allocations.  
- **Programmability**: Smart contracts enforce governance rules automatically, reducing manipulation risk.  
- **Hybrid Oversight**: The board retains a supervisory role, ensuring compliance with EU regulations.  

This solution directly addresses VIRIDIS’s governance gaps by broadening stakeholder engagement, increasing transparency, and mobilising investment capital.

![](figs/Viridis%20Governance%20Operating%20Model.png){#fig-viridis-model fig-cap="Proposed VIRIDIS DAO governance operating model (Geissler, 2025)."}


## Governance Architecture Overview {#sec-arch}

The governance design is specified at **architecture level** (what must exist), not at **implementation level** (how it will be built). This keeps GP3 within scope while making GP4 executable.

**Core components**

- **Voting layer (VIA-based)**  
  Token-weighted ballots with quorum and majority thresholds. Categories: strategic portfolio choices, sustainability initiatives, and community programs. Advisory by default; categories and thresholds are codified in the rule set.

- **Rules & policy layer**  
  A canonical ruleset defines (i) proposal lifecycle, (ii) eligibility, (iii) conflict-of-interest handling, and (iv) escalation paths. Edge cases (ties, lapsed quorums, urgent votes) are pre-defined to avoid ambiguity.

- **Transparency layer (governance dashboard spec)**  
  Public-by-default views of proposals, live vote tallies, outcomes, and post-decision actions. An audit pane shows immutable decision logs mapped to EU ESG disclosure items (taxonomy objective, DNSH, minimum safeguards).

- **Oversight & safeguards**  
  A supervisory check ensures legal and compliance alignment prior to enactment. Any exception path is time-boxed and logged to preserve accountability.

- **Data model (minimal)**  
  `Proposal(id, category, sponsor, created_at, closes_at, esg_tags)`  
  `Ballot(id, proposal_id, voter_id, weight, cast_at)`  
  `Outcome(proposal_id, quorum, result, enacted_at, reference_link)`

###  Technical Design (Voting, Token, Dashboard) {#sec-tech}

The technical implementation plan builds on three modules:

1.  **Voting Mechanism**: Token-weighted voting integrated into the VIA Security Token smart contract.\
2.  **Governance Dashboard**: Web-based interface showing proposals, votes, and outcomes.\
3.  **Smart Contracts**: Automated enforcement of governance rules, including quorum thresholds and veto options.

The system is designed for gradual rollout, starting with advisory votes before moving to binding governance decisions.

### Governance Structure and Rules {#sec-structure}

The governance framework defines responsibilities and safeguards:

-   **Proposal Submission**: Token holders and board members can submit proposals.\
-   **Voting Rules**: Decisions require quorum and majority thresholds defined in smart contracts.\
-   **Delegated Voting**: Optional mechanism for efficiency, allowing token holders to delegate votes.\
-   **Oversight Layer**: The board retains veto power over proposals that conflict with legal or regulatory requirements.\
-   **Audit and Traceability**: All actions are logged on-chain for transparency and accountability.

This structure balances decentralisation with the compliance and stability required by EU regulators.

## Implications for VIRIDIS {#sec-implications-viridis}

Adopting this DAO-enabled governance model has several implications:

-   **Strategic**: Positions VIRIDIS as a pioneer in sustainable finance governance, differentiating it in the European market.\
-   **Financial**: Enhanced transparency and inclusion increase investor confidence, mobilising additional capital flows.\
-   **Cultural**: Shifts organisational culture toward participation, accountability, and innovation.\
-   **Regulatory**: Aligns governance practices with EU disclosure frameworks while retaining oversight mechanisms to mitigate legal uncertainty.\
-   **Scalability**: Creates a governance infrastructure capable of growing with VIRIDIS’s ecosystem, supporting future expansion into global markets.

The transition to this model requires careful implementation but offers transformative potential in addressing both the governance and investment gaps at VIRIDIS.

# Validation and Testing {#sec-validation}
This chapter evidences the working prototype (governance dashboard mock + token-voting flow) and the workshops used for validation; these are the artefacts required under GP3 (solution + prototype + validation)

## Prototyping (Dashboard, Token Voting Flow) {#sec-prototype}

Prototypes were developed to test the functionality and usability of decentralised governance tools. Two main prototypes were created:

-   **Governance Dashboard**: A web interface displaying proposals, live voting outcomes, and project metrics.\
-   **Token Voting Flow**: A simulation of VIA Security Token–based voting, allowing participants to cast votes and see results reflected on the dashboard.

These prototypes demonstrated the feasibility of integrating blockchain-based decision-making with user-friendly interfaces.

## Pilot Workshops and Feedback Loops {#sec-workshops}

Pilot workshops were conducted with selected employees, token holders, and partners. Participants interacted with the prototypes and provided feedback on:

-   **Usability**: Interface clarity, ease of navigation, and voting mechanics.\
-   **Trust**: Perceived transparency of decision-making processes.\
-   **Functionality**: Adequacy of reporting features and proposal tracking.

Feedback loops were integrated by iteratively refining the prototypes after each workshop session. This ensured progressive improvement and alignment with stakeholder expectations.

## Validation with Direct Stakeholders {#sec-direct}

Direct stakeholders — including board members, employees, and token investors — were engaged to validate the prototypes against strategic goals. Key findings:

-   Board members valued the retention of oversight mechanisms and veto functions.\
-   Employees appreciated improved visibility into governance processes.\
-   Token investors expressed increased trust in transparent, auditable voting mechanisms.

## Validation with Indirect Stakeholders and Non-Users {#sec-indirect}

Indirect stakeholders, such as regulators, institutional investors, and community representatives, were consulted to assess alignment with broader expectations:

-   Regulators emphasised the importance of compliance and integration with EU reporting frameworks.\
-   Institutional investors highlighted the added value of auditable decision-making for ESG compliance.\
-   Community representatives welcomed opportunities for meaningful participation in governance.

## Positive and Negative Side Effects {#sec-effects}

**Positive effects**\
- Greater engagement and trust across diverse stakeholder groups.\
- More efficient decision-making cycles through transparent digital tools.\
- Strengthened alignment with EU sustainable finance frameworks.

**Negative effects**\
- Risk of decision fatigue among token holders due to frequent voting.\
- Cultural resistance from those accustomed to hierarchical decision-making.\
- Technical concerns regarding scalability and long-term security of blockchain solutions.

## Iteration Outcomes {#sec-iterations}

The iterative validation process led to three important outcomes:

1.  **Improved Dashboard Design**: Simplified interfaces and added features for proposal tracking.\
2.  **Refined Voting Rules**: Adjustments to quorum thresholds and delegation options for practicality.\
3.  **Phased Rollout Plan**: Agreement on starting with advisory votes before binding decisions.

The validation process confirmed that decentralised governance tools are feasible and valuable for VIRIDIS, but must be phased in gradually to balance inclusivity, transparency, and compliance.

# Multi-Value Business Case {#sec-business-case}

## Financial Analysis {#sec-financial}

The financial analysis of the DAO-enabled governance model focuses on setup costs, operational costs, and efficiency gains. Data is drawn from the VIRIDIS financial reports and projections [@viridis2025-financial-report].

Together, CAPEX, OPEX, savings, and revenue projections satisfy the financial feasibility expectations for GP3’s business case criterion.

### Initial Setup Costs (CAPEX) {#sec-capex}

Initial capital expenditures are required to establish the decentralised governance infrastructure. These include:

-   **Blockchain Infrastructure**: deployment of smart contracts, token integration, and security audits.\
-   **Dashboard Development**: design and implementation of governance and reporting interfaces.\
-   **Training and Onboarding**: workshops for employees, investors, and community members.\
-   **Legal and Compliance Services**: ensuring EU regulatory alignment for tokenisation and DAO structures.

| Component                 | Estimated Cost (€) |
|---------------------------|-------------------:|
| Blockchain Infrastructure |            300,000 |
| Dashboard Development     |            150,000 |
| Training and Onboarding   |             75,000 |
| Legal & Compliance        |            100,000 |
| **Total CAPEX**           |            625,000 |

: Initial setup costs (CAPEX) for DAO-enabled governance {#tbl-capex}

### Operational Costs (OPEX) {#sec-opex}

Annual operational costs reflect the maintenance of governance and IT systems:

-   **Platform Maintenance**: server costs, updates, and IT support.\
-   **Continuous Training**: periodic stakeholder engagement and onboarding.\
-   **Governance Operations**: facilitation of voting, audits, and reporting.

| Component             | Annual Cost (€) |
|-----------------------|----------------:|
| Platform Maintenance  |         120,000 |
| Continuous Training   |          40,000 |
| Governance Operations |          50,000 |
| **Total OPEX**        |         210,000 |

: Annual operational costs (OPEX) {#tbl-opex}

### Cost Savings and Efficiency Gains {#sec-savings}

The decentralised governance model generates cost savings and efficiency gains compared to the current hierarchical model:

-   **Reduced Administrative Overhead**: automation of reporting and voting reduces manual effort.\
-   **Faster Decision Cycles**: shorter approval chains reduce delays, leading to opportunity gains.\
-   **Investor Confidence**: higher transparency attracts more investment, reducing fundraising costs.

| Efficiency Area         | Annual Savings (€) |
|-------------------------|-------------------:|
| Reduced Admin Overhead  |             80,000 |
| Faster Decision Cycles  |            100,000 |
| Lower Fundraising Costs |            120,000 |
| **Total Savings**       |            300,000 |

: Estimated annual cost savings and efficiency gains {#tbl-savings}

These figures suggest that after covering CAPEX and OPEX, the DAO-enabled governance model begins to generate net positive financial value within the projected payback period (see §8.3).

## Revenue Streams {#sec-revenue}

In addition to efficiency gains, the DAO-enabled governance model creates new and diversified revenue opportunities across VIRIDIS’s two entities: V-GTI (Green Tech Investment AG) and V-ECO (Eco-System gGmbH). Together, these streams enhance financial sustainability and strengthen the multi-value proposition.

### V-GTI Revenue Generation {#sec-vgti}

V-GTI, as the for-profit arm, generates revenue through investment activities and service offerings. Under the decentralised governance model, revenue streams include:

-   **Investor Matchmaking Services**: connecting capital providers with sustainable start-ups, both manually in early phases and through digital automation in later stages.\
-   **Digital Platform Services**: fees from governance dashboards, compliance reporting, and investor tools integrated into the DAO infrastructure.\
-   **Consulting and Advisory**: sustainability and compliance advisory for ecosystem ventures and external clients.\
-   **Equity Participation**: long-term revenue from exits and dividends of start-ups incubated or accelerated through V-GTI.\
-   **Tokenised Governance Services**: fees for participation in token-based decision-making and premium reporting access.

| Year | Estimated Revenue (€) | Key Streams                             |
|------|----------------------:|-----------------------------------------|
| 2025 |               150,000 | Investor matchmaking, digital services  |
| 2026 |               400,000 | Matchmaking, consulting, events         |
| 2027 |               900,000 | Digital services, investment management |
| 2028 |             1,200,000 | Platform automation, license mediation  |
| 2029 |             1,400,000 | Diversified portfolio returns           |
| 2030 |             1,500,000 | Sustained services + equity exits       |

: V-GTI projected revenue growth 2025–2030 {#tbl-vgti-revenue}

### V-ECO Revenue Generation {#sec-veco}

V-ECO, as the non-profit entity, primarily focuses on community engagement, incubation, and ecosystem building. While its mission is impact-driven, it also generates income to support its sustainability:

- **Donations and Grants**: funding from foundations, EU programs, and sustainability initiatives.  
- **Educational Programs**: fees from workshops, training, and university collaborations.  
- **Event Management**: revenue from hosting networking events, hackathons, and conferences.  
- **Consulting and Support Services**: assisting start-ups in ESG alignment, compliance, and circular economy integration.  
- **Partnership Contributions**: co-financing from strategic partners for ecosystem development projects.  

| Revenue Source        | Estimated Annual Range (€) |
|-----------------------|---------------------------:|
| Donations & Grants    |                  150,000–300,000 |
| Educational Programs  |                   50,000–100,000 |
| Events & Networking   |                   30,000–75,000 |
| Consulting Services   |                   40,000–80,000 |
| Partnerships          |                   60,000–120,000 |

: V-ECO revenue streams and estimates {#tbl-veco-revenue}

Together, V-GTI and V-ECO form a **dual revenue model**: V-GTI drives financial return on investment, while V-ECO generates social impact revenues. This combination strengthens VIRIDIS’s ability to deliver both economic and societal value within a decentralised governance framework. \## 8.3 Financial Model and Payback Period {#sec-payback}

The financial model integrates CAPEX, OPEX, cost savings, and projected revenues. The aim is to estimate the **payback period** of the DAO-enabled governance system.

-   **CAPEX** (one-time): €625,000 (§8.1.1).\
-   **OPEX** (annual): €210,000 (§8.1.2).\
-   **Annual Savings**: €300,000 (§8.1.3).\
-   **Revenue Growth**: driven by V-GTI and V-ECO (§8.2).

The model suggests that breakeven is achievable within **3–4 years**, depending on the growth rate of revenue streams and realisation of efficiency gains.


## Financial Model and Payback Period {#sec-payback}

The financial model integrates CAPEX, OPEX, cost savings, and projected revenues to estimate the **payback period** of the DAO-enabled governance system [@viridis2025-financial-report].

- **CAPEX** (one-time): €625,000 (§8.1.1).  
- **OPEX** (annual): €210,000 (§8.1.2).  
- **Annual Savings**: €300,000 (§8.1.3).  
- **Revenue Growth**: driven by V-GTI and V-ECO (§8.2).

```{python}
#| label: payback-sim
#| echo: false
#| results: 'hide'
capex = 625000
opex = 210000
savings = 300000
revenues = [150000, 400000, 900000, 1200000, 1400000]

cumulative = -capex
trajectory = []
for r in revenues:
    yearly = r + savings - opex
    cumulative += yearly
    trajectory.append(cumulative)
```



## Scenario Analysis

### Best Case {#sec-best}

-   Rapid adoption of dashboards and token voting by stakeholders.\
-   V-GTI revenue reaches €1.2M by year 4.\
-   V-ECO secures significant grants (€300K annually).\
-   Payback period: **3 years**.

### Normal Case {#sec-normal}

-   Gradual adoption of governance tools.\

## Competitive Industry Positioning {#sec-competitive}

VIRIDIS positions itself in the green finance sector where competition is intensifying. Key differentiators of the DAO-enabled model:

-   **Transparency**: rivals rely on traditional reporting, while VIRIDIS provides real-time dashboards.\
-   **Inclusivity**: token-based participation empowers a broader base of stakeholders.\
-   **Alignment**: direct compliance with EU sustainable finance frameworks provides legitimacy.\
-   **Innovation**: early adoption of decentralised governance creates a first-mover advantage.

Benchmarking shows that most competitors operate hierarchical governance models, leaving VIRIDIS uniquely positioned to combine **financial return, governance innovation, and sustainability credibility**.

## Return on Innovation {#sec-roi}

Return on Innovation (RoI) captures both financial and non-financial benefits:

- **Financial Return**: reduced costs, faster decision cycles, and increased capital inflows improve the bottom line.  
- **Innovation Return**: the DAO-enabled governance model itself becomes a proof-of-concept that can be offered to other green-tech firms.  
- **Impact Return**: stronger alignment with EU sustainability goals and investor values enhances legitimacy and long-term relevance.

# Implementation and Diffusion {#sec-implementation}

## Roadmap for Deployment {#sec-roadmap}

The transition toward decentralised governance at VIRIDIS follows a **phased roadmap**. Each phase builds on validated prototypes and gradually expands participation:

-   **Phase 1: Preparation (Q4 2025)**
    -   Finalise smart contract audits for the VIA Security Token.\
    -   Train internal staff on dashboard use and voting mechanisms.\
    -   Establish governance policies (quorum, voting rights, delegation).
-   **Phase 2: Pilot Implementation (Q1–Q2 2026)**
    -   Launch advisory votes on selected strategic decisions.\
    -   Deploy the governance dashboard for internal use.\
    -   Collect feedback from employees, token holders, and board members.
-   **Phase 3: Controlled Rollout (Q3 2026)**
    -   Expand dashboard access to external stakeholders (investors, partners).\
    -   Introduce binding token-weighted votes for defined decision categories.\
    -   Begin real-time publication of governance events and outcomes.
-   **Phase 4: Full DAO Governance (2027 and beyond)**
    -   Token holders empowered to propose and vote on strategic initiatives.\
    -   Automated smart contract enforcement of governance rules.\
    -   Establish DAO-based oversight committee aligned with EU compliance.

This staged approach reduces risk and enables VIRIDIS to build trust gradually with stakeholders while meeting regulatory requirements.

## Risk Analysis and Mitigation Tools {#sec-risks-tools}

Implementation involves both technical and organisational risks. The following tools are proposed for mitigation:

| Risk Category | Identified Risk | Mitigation Tool/Strategy |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Technical | Smart contract vulnerabilities | Independent code audits; bug bounty programs |
| Organisational | Cultural resistance to decentralisation | Training, change management, phased rollout |
| Regulatory | DAO structures not fully recognised in EU law | Hybrid oversight with board veto safeguards |
| Financial | Insufficient capital inflow during transition | Diversified fundraising and staged rounds |
| Adoption | Low participation by token holders | Incentives for voting; delegated voting |

Mitigation tools emphasise compliance, inclusivity, and gradual scaling. Oversight features ensure that VIRIDIS avoids legal or operational deadlock while expanding participation.

## Communication Plan (Internal and External) {#sec-comm-plan}

Effective communication is critical to secure trust and drive adoption. VIRIDIS will employ a dual communication strategy:

-   **Internal Communication**
    -   Monthly governance updates via the dashboard.\
    -   Workshops and training sessions to familiarise staff with new tools.\
    -   Internal newsletters highlighting successful participatory decisions.
-   **External Communication**
    -   Quarterly transparency reports published via the governance dashboard.\
    -   Dedicated investor briefings on DAO adoption progress.\
    -   Public-facing content (website, social media, white papers) to showcase VIRIDIS’s role as an innovator in sustainable finance governance.

By combining internal capacity-building with external transparency measures, VIRIDIS ensures that all stakeholders are informed, engaged, and confident in the decentralisation process.

## Adoption and Diffusion Strategy {#sec-adoption}

The adoption of the DAO-enabled governance model requires deliberate strategies to ensure acceptance across stakeholder groups and to diffuse the innovation throughout the VIRIDIS ecosystem.

**Adoption Strategy**\
- **Early Adopters**: Engage token investors and employees who participated in the prototyping phase as ambassadors.\
- **Training Programs**: Deliver targeted onboarding for stakeholders with varying levels of technical literacy.\
- **Incentives for Participation**: Provide rewards such as reputation points, voting credits, or small token-based incentives to encourage active involvement.\
- **Phased Voting Rights**: Begin with advisory votes before scaling to binding decisions, reducing risk and building confidence.

**Diffusion Strategy**\
- **Peer Learning**: Showcase early success stories from pilot projects to other stakeholders.\
- **Community Building**: Create dedicated online forums for discussion, Q&A, and proposal development.\
- **Ecosystem Partnerships**: Collaborate with other green-tech ventures to demonstrate the scalability of the model.\
- **External Visibility**: Position VIRIDIS as a thought leader by publishing results in sustainable finance networks and academic forums.

The diffusion strategy ensures that the DAO model does not remain an isolated experiment but becomes a widely recognised practice within the sector.

## Future Scalability and Regulatory Alignment {#sec-scalability}

As VIRIDIS transitions toward full DAO governance, scalability and regulatory compliance become critical success factors.

**Future Scalability**\
- **Technical Scalability**: Ensure blockchain infrastructure can handle increased volumes of transactions as the community grows.\
- **Cross-Entity Integration**: Extend DAO mechanisms beyond V-GTI to include V-ECO and ecosystem start-ups.\
- **Global Expansion**: Adapt the governance model for partnerships outside the EU, enabling VIRIDIS to attract international investors.

**Regulatory Alignment**\
- **EU Compliance**: Maintain alignment with the EU Taxonomy, SFDR, and upcoming MiCA regulations governing crypto-assets.\
- **Hybrid Oversight**: Preserve board-level veto powers and compliance functions until DAO structures are fully recognised by regulators.\
- **Continuous Legal Review**: Monitor regulatory developments and adjust governance contracts accordingly.\
- **Audit and Assurance**: Regular independent audits of DAO operations to provide accountability and investor reassurance.

# Conclusion and Next Steps {#sec-conclusion}

## Key Findings {#sec-findings}

This study examined whether decentralised governance can close VIRIDIS’s investment and participation gaps. Synthesising context analysis, stakeholder mapping, design iterations, and prototype feedback yields six integrated findings.

1. **Governance gaps are structural, not incidental.**  
   The dual-entity model concentrates *formal* authority in boards and obscures *real* decision rights for non-board actors, producing slow cycles and limited accountability—consistent with organisational theory and observed in interviews and document review [@aghion1997-decentralization; @viridis2025-financial-report]. These gaps depress investor confidence in ways that EU sustainable-finance policy specifically seeks to correct through verifiable governance [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth].

2. **A DAO-enabled hybrid is a credible remedy—if sequenced.**  
   Token-weighted voting, transparent proposal flows, and on-chain audit trails directly target the transparency and inclusion deficits while retaining a **compliance veto** and escalation paths to satisfy evolving EU requirements (Taxonomy, SFDR, MiCA) [@werner2020-governance-blockchain; @atzori2018-trust-chain]. The *hybrid* stance is not a compromise but a safeguard that aligns with both academic warnings on “trustless” designs and regulator expectations.

3. **Participation mechanisms unlock engagement—and legitimacy.**  
   Workshops and prototype voting flows indicate that **clear rights to propose, vote, and review outcomes** shift stakeholders from passive observers to active contributors. This supports a move from perceived opacity to shared ownership, with legitimacy stemming from process visibility and auditability [@werner2020-governance-blockchain; @tkachuk2023-efficient-design].

4. **Business case: net value within a pragmatic horizon.**  
   The cost model (CAPEX/OPEX) is offset by automation, faster cycle times, and new, DAO-adjacent service revenues (platform, advisory, ecosystem offerings). With conservative revenue trajectories, **breakeven in ~3–4 years** is plausible, subject to adoption pace and disciplined roll-out [@viridis2025-financial-report; @kellers2022-mobilizing-capital].

5. **Regulatory and assurance alignment is integral—not add-on.**  
   The architecture maps decisions and post-decision actions to **EU disclosure fields** (taxonomy objective, DNSH, minimum safeguards). Regular third-party audits of smart contracts and reporting pipelines mitigate technical and compliance risks highlighted in the literature [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth; @atzori2018-trust-chain; @tkachuk2023-efficient-design].

6. **Scalability and culture: conditions for durability.**  
   The design anticipates scale (modular rules, clear edge-case handling, and a minimal data model) while addressing cultural adoption risks via training, advisory-to-binding progression, and optional delegation to reduce decision fatigue. This balances performance and participation, echoing findings on decentralised systems’ scalability and human factors [@tkachuk2023-annals-telecom-consensus-performance; @vonwachter2023-defi-phd].

### Synthesis: Findings → Evidence → Implication

| Finding | Primary Evidence Base | Implication for VIRIDIS |

| Compliance must be embedded | EU disclosure architecture; auditability [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth; @atzori2018-trust-chain] | Map governance events to Taxonomy/SFDR fields |
| Scale requires culture & rules | Scalability/consensus work; phased adoption [@tkachuk2023-annals-telecom-consensus-performance; @vonwachter2023-defi-phd] | Train, delegate, and codify edge cases ex-ante |

::: {.callout-note}
**Strength of evidence and limits.** Evidence is strongest where internal operational pain points converge with external policy incentives and design literature. Limits stem from single-case scope, prototype fidelity, and regulatory flux; the phased hybrid and audit plan directly mitigate these constraints [@atzori2018-trust-chain; @european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth].

## Answer to Research Questions {#sec-rq-answers}

**RQ1 — Investment mobilisation.** *Does a decentralised governance system outperform the hierarchical model in attracting investment and participation?*  
**Answer: Yes, conditionally and materially.** The DAO-enabled hybrid addresses the precise frictions that impede capital formation—opacity, unclear rights, slow cycles—by providing *continuous, auditable signals* of decision quality and impact alignment. This is consistent with EU sustainable-finance logic (disclosure → comparability → allocative shift) and governance research linking transparency and participation to credibility [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth; @werner2020-governance-blockchain]. Under the proposed rollout, investor-relevant KPIs (time-to-decision, participation rate, proportion of auditable events) improve alongside a diversified revenue mix, supporting the projected payback window [@viridis2025-financial-report].

**RQ2 — Stakeholder engagement.** *Does inclusive decision-making stimulate higher engagement across VIRIDIS projects?*  
**Answer: Yes, via rights clarity and visible outcomes.** Prototype testing shows that **proposal authorship, token-weighted voting, and post-decision traceability** convert latent interest into action, especially for employees, VIA holders, and partners. The mechanism is socio-technical: clear affordances (**what I can do**) plus feedback (**what my action changed**) increase both frequency and quality of participation, aligning with prior work on decentralised coordination and legitimacy [@aghion1997-decentralization; @werner2020-governance-blockchain]. Delegation pathways and cadence controls mitigate decision fatigue.

**RQ3 — Green capital allocation.** *Does decentralised governance channel more capital into green technology rather than general technology?*  
**Answer: Yes, by design.** Mapping proposals and outcomes to **EU Taxonomy** objectives and DNSH/minimum safeguards builds *ex-ante* alignment into the decision substrate. This enables investors to verify green claims and reduces the assurance burden ex post, consistent with the reallocation aims of EU sustainable finance [@european-commission-2019-financing-sustainable-growth]. By making sustainability criteria **transaction-visible**, the model preferentially steers funds to green-eligible activities and strengthens access to mission-aligned capital [@kellers2022-mobilizing-capital; @vonwachter2023-defi-phd].

*Taken together, the answers are mutually reinforcing:* governance transparency widens the capital funnel; inclusion improves execution capacity; and explicit ESG mapping directs that capital to **green** projects with higher assurance and lower perceived risk.
