## Key Economic Concepts

This section defines the core economic concepts underpinning the analysis of decentralized investment systems.

**1. Information Asymmetry:** A situation where one party in a transaction possesses more information than the other. In traditional finance, fund managers often have superior information compared to investors, leading to potential agency problems.

**2. Agency Problem:** Arises when the interests of a principal (investor) and an agent (fund manager) are not aligned. Agents may act in their own self-interest, potentially harming the principal.

**3. Principal-Agent Theory:** A framework for understanding the relationship between principals and agents, and for designing mechanisms to mitigate agency problems.

**4. Network Effects:** The value of a network increases as more participants join. Decentralized systems often exhibit strong network effects, enhancing their utility and security.

**5. Trust:** A belief in the reliability, truth, ability, or strength of someone or something. In financial markets, trust is essential for facilitating transactions and attracting investment.

**6. Tokenomics:** The economic principles governing the creation, distribution, and use of tokens within a blockchain-based ecosystem. Tokenomics play a crucial role in incentivizing participation and ensuring the long-term sustainability of decentralized systems.

**7. Game Theory:** The study of strategic interactions between rational agents. Game theory can be used to analyze the behavior of participants in decentralized governance mechanisms.
