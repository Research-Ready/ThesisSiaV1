## Decentralized Investment Structures

Traditional investment structures are characterized by centralized intermediaries, such as banks, brokers, and fund managers, who control the flow of capital and provide investment services. Decentralized systems disrupt this model by removing intermediaries and enabling peer-to-peer transactions.

**1. Traditional Investment Structures:**
   *  Hierarchical organization with clear lines of authority.
   *  Reliance on trusted intermediaries for custody, settlement, and regulatory compliance.
   *  Limited transparency and potential for conflicts of interest.

**2. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):**
   *  Organizations governed by rules encoded in smart contracts.
   *  Decision-making power distributed among token holders.
   *  Increased transparency and reduced reliance on central authorities.

**3. Blockchain-Based Investment Funds:**
   *  Funds managed on a blockchain, with assets represented as tokens.
   *  Automated execution of investment strategies through smart contracts.
   *  Enhanced security and reduced operational costs.

**4. Tokenized Assets:**
   *  Traditional assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate) represented as digital tokens on a blockchain.
   *  Increased liquidity and accessibility for investors.
   *  Fractional ownership and reduced investment barriers.

These shifts in investment structures have significant implications for investor trust, risk management, and market efficiency.
